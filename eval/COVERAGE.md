# Coverage — what "100%" means

<!-- GENERATED FILE — edit src/eval/coverage/taxonomy.ts, then run `npm run eval:coverage`. -->

A taxonomy leaf counts as covered only when all three hold: **K** a knowledge entry teaches it · **E** an eval case with a captured golden proves it · **T** the tool path can create/validate the artifact. Flags are derived from the live sources (`KNOWLEDGE_BASE`, `eval/cases`, the create/scaffold registry), so a deleted case or a renamed entry drops the number.

**core** = anything done at least once per project — the hard commitment. **total** = core plus exotics (license codes, XDS, aggregate measurements), a visible asymptote rather than a target.

| Tier | Covered | Leaves | % |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| core | 34 | 43 | **79.1%** |
| total | 37 | 77 | 48.1% |
