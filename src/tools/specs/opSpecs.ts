/**
 * Op-spec lookup — the on-demand replacement for the parameter contracts that
 * used to be inlined in the `d365fo_file` and `generate_object` wire schemas.
 *
 * Issue #825: those two schemas were 18,5 KB of the 63 KB ListTools payload,
 * re-sent on every request, because each inlined a discriminated union of every
 * operation and its parameters. The discriminators (`action`, `operation`,
 * `objectType`, `mode`, `pattern`) stay in the schema as closed enums — the
 * parameters behind the one the agent picks are fetched here, once.
 *
 * Reachable as get_knowledge(kind="op-spec", topic="<operation|objectType|mode>");
 * every validation error that reports a missing parameter names that call, so
 * the contract is never more than one lookup away.

 * get_knowledge(kind="op-spec", …) — or, worse, a failed write that returned the
 * spec in its error. prepare already knows the objectType and, for a change, the
 * method, so it can hand the contract over in the call the agent was making
 * anyway. That is a few hundred bytes against a whole round trip.
 *
 * `operation` is used when the caller names one. Otherwise a change targeting a
 * method is going to write one, so add-method's contract is the right guess; a
 * change with no method has no confident guess and only gets the pointer.
 *
 * SEVERAL operations, not one. An ordinary table change is add-field AND
 * add-index AND add-field-to-field-group; rendering only the first still left
 * the agent to spend a get_knowledge(kind="op-spec") round trip on the rest,
 * which is the hop this section exists to remove (get_knowledge was called 186
 * times against 81 prepares in the sampled sessions). `operation` therefore
 * accepts a comma-separated string or an array — a clause in the wire schema
