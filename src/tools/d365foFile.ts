/**
 * d365fo_file Tool — unified file/metadata-operation entry point.
 *
 * One tool discriminated by `action`:
 *   • generate → produce AOT XML as TEXT only (Azure/Linux fallback, no write)
 *   • create   → write a NEW AOT object file into PackagesLocalDirectory (write)
 *   • modify   → edit an EXISTING object via IMetadataProvider (write)
 *   • delete   → remove an object's XML and its .rnrproj registration (write)
 *   • undo     → roll a file back to HEAD, or delete it when untracked (write)
 *
 * Like `labels`, this mixes a read-capable action (generate works on Azure
 * read-only) with write actions that need local Windows-VM filesystem access;
 * it therefore lives in ALWAYS_TOOLS and the underlying create/modify handlers
 * return a clear error when the local filesystem is not reachable. Handler
 * files stay where they are — only the MCP surface is consolidated.
