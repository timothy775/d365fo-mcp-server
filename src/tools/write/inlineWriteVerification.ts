 * the file in; checking that the bytes are on disk and that the .rnrproj really
 * references them is two filesystem reads, not a round trip.
 *
 * Kept deliberately narrow. This is NOT verify_d365fo_project — that tool sweeps
 * a whole project and cross-checks every object, which is a different job and
 * still worth its own call. This answers only "did the thing I just claimed to
 * do actually land", which is precisely the question the follow-up call was
