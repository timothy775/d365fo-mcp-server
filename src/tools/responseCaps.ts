/**
 * Per-tool response caps and the advice printed after a cut.

 * pins `toolHandler.ts` under 500 lines on the rule that the dispatcher ROUTES

/**
 * Per-tool response cap sizes. 'uncapped' = no truncation.
 *
 * The caps are a context-budget guard, not a quality target: a response cut
 * short of the thing the call existed to deliver costs an extra round trip,
 * and a round trip re-bills the whole cached context (~1.5 AIU floor here).
 * Cutting is therefore only cheaper than not cutting when what is lost is
 * genuinely optional.
 *
 * Measured over 1,400 real MCP calls from Copilot sessions on this VM:
 *   • prepare      — result size p50 4,966 / p90 5,011 chars against the 5,000
 *     default, i.e. essentially EVERY prepare was being cut, always in its last
 *     sections. Raised to 12,000; prepareChange/prepareCreate also moved the
 *     write contract and the grounding token ahead of the discovery sections so
 *     a cut can only ever cost discovery, never the deliverable.
 *   • get_knowledge — called 186 times against only 81 prepares, and its batch
 *     form (topics[]) 0 times, because a knowledge topic measures 8–12 KB and
 *     was halved by the same 5,000 default. Bounded at 16,000 (a number, not
 *     'uncapped', so a runaway topics[] batch cannot flood the context); the
 *     renderer in tools/knowledge/getKnowledge.ts spends its own smaller budget
 *     in whole topics first, so this cap is a backstop rather than the cutter.
