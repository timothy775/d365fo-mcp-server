/**
 * Server mode + tool profile configuration.
 *
 * Two independent axes decide which tools this MCP server instance publishes:
 *
 *  1. LOCALITY (MCP_SERVER_MODE=full|read-only|write-only) — which half of the
 *     toolset this process can physically serve, enabling a hybrid deployment
 *     where an Azure-hosted instance runs 'read-only' (search / analysis) and a
 *     local Windows VM instance runs 'write-only' (file operations).
 *
 *  2. BREADTH (MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=full|core) — how much of the toolset is worth
 *     advertising at all. Hosts stop sending the tool catalogue inline past a
 *     limit (VS Code: ~100 tools across all servers) and switch the model to a
 *     search-based tool surface, which costs a discovery round trip per tool it
 *     needs (issue #825). 'core' publishes only the plan → discover → write →
 *     build → verify loop; MCP_EXTRA_TOOLS adds individual tools back.
 *
 * isToolEnabled() is the single predicate combining both, shared by the
 * ListTools filter and the runtime call gate so they cannot drift apart.
