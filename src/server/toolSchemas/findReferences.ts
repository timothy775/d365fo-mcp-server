For a method, SCOPE it to its declaring type — pass "Owner.method" (e.g. "SalesTable.initFromSalesQuotationTable"), set ownerName alongside a bare method name, or pass an AOT path ("/Tables/SalesTable/Methods/initFromSalesQuotationTable"). A bare method name (no owner) matches that name on every type and over-reports. For a label, pass the label id as targetName (e.g. "@WAX2194" or "@MyLabelFile:MyLabel"); results span every referencing object type (tables, forms, EDTs, enums, reports, menu items, …), not just code, and require the xref database (DYNAMICSXREFDB, full server mode).',
