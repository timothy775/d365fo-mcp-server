/**
 * MCP tool definition for `get_workspace_info` (name/description/inputSchema),
 * extracted verbatim from mcpServer.ts. Serialized payload must not change
 * unintentionally — tests/utils/toolSchemaBudget.test.ts ratchets its size.
 *
 * `changes` was folded in from the retired `review_workspace_changes` tool.
 * Both were LOCAL, read-only and about the same workspace, and the retired
 * tool's published description promised "BP violations, missing labels, CoC
 * patterns" while its handler only ever ran `git diff HEAD --unified=3` and
 * appended undo hints. The knob below describes what it actually returns.
