/**
 * Harness-level eval fixtures — the INPUT/OUTPUT classifier, fixture loader, and
 * rollback-exclusion partition (VM-free, pure). See docs/AGENT_EVAL_LOOP.md
 * §4a/§11 and eval/fixtures/README.md.
 *
 * Problem this solves. A handful of `ConDemo*` objects (chiefly the table
 * `ConDemoNoteHeader`) are SHARED across cases: one case creates them, ~18 others
 * READ from them. But the implementer protocol rolls back every case after
 * scoring, so a shared object created by a case cannot survive — each rollback
 * re-breaks every dependent case. The fix is to lift such shared INPUTS out of
 * the cases into repo-committed fixtures (eval/fixtures/*.metadata.xml) that are
 * (re)provisioned before each dependent case and EXCLUDED from that case's
 * rollback.
 *
 * The crux is telling INPUTS apart from the ~50 `ConDemo*`/`DemoNote*` names the
 * catalog mentions — MOST of which are case OUTPUTS that must NOT be
 * pre-provisioned. This module derives that split from the catalog itself:
 *   - a base name referenced by exactly ONE case is that case's OUTPUT;
 *   - a base name referenced by MORE THAN ONE case is SHARED and needs an
 *     explicit decision (INPUT fixture / OUTPUT / needs-review) recorded in
 *     SHARED_DECISIONS below.
 * `unresolved` (a shared base with no decision) is what a new case introducing a
 * silent cross-case dependency would surface — the unit test fails on it, so the
 * harness can never drift into an unprovisioned shared object again.
 *
 * VM-free boundary: this module classifies and partitions. Actually WRITING the
 * fixture into the sandbox (`d365fo_file` create) and reindexing
 * (`update_symbol_index`) is the agent/VM step — see the protocol docs.
