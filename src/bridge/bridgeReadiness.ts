/**
 * Bridge startup readiness gate.
 *
 * The MCP tool list goes live the moment the handshake completes, but the C#
 * bridge is spawned out-of-band (see `initializeBridge` in src/index.ts) and
 * needs a few seconds to bring up its metadata provider. Until then
 * `context.bridge` is undefined, so a bridge-backed tool called in that window
 * fell through every read path and reported a configuration problem — a
 * diagnostic dead end, because nothing is wrong and the identical call succeeds
 * seconds later (issue #826).
 *
 * The fix has two halves, both in this module:
 *  1. `awaitBridgeReady` — the dispatcher waits (bounded) for a startup that is
 *     still in flight, so the agent never observes the race. Trading a 3-second
 *     LLM round trip for a 2-second in-process wait is a straight win.
 *  2. `bridgeStartupState` / `describeBridgeStartup` — when the wait genuinely
 *     times out, the "not found" messages can say the bridge is still starting
 *     instead of telling the user to go fix a config that is fine.
