 *
 * `dataRoot` is where *this installation's* configuration, metadata index and
 * instances live. In a git checkout the two are the same directory and nothing
 * about the old layout changes. An npm install has to separate them: `npm
 * install -g d365fo-mcp@latest` replaces the package directory wholesale, so a
 * config file or a 2 GB index kept inside it would not survive a single
 * update. There the setup wizard asks for a directory and records it in a
