/**
 * Keeps one target's BP-moniker catalog (src/knowledge/bpMonikers/) matching
 * its own pinned D365FO version, instead of every instance sharing the one
 * snapshot committed in catalog.generated.ts (see that module's docblock).
 *
 * Called as a step of rebuildIndex() (indexCmd.ts) — the one place already
 * reached by instance creation, upgrade, routine rebuild, `update`, and the
 * first-time setup wizard. Regeneration only actually runs when the stamped
 * version in the target's existing catalog file differs from what this
 * target resolves to now (or the file does not exist yet); every other call
 * is a cheap read-and-compare with no subprocess spawned.
 *
 * Two things this module will not do, both because the result would be
 * self-perpetuating — whatever it stamps with the current version key is what
 * every later rebuild treats as up to date: extract from an install that is
 * not this target's (resolveSource), and accept an extraction that only
 * partially read the one that is (verifyExtraction).

 * bin\BPExtensions\ in place leaves bin\ untouched, the key matches, and the
 * catalog is never regenerated — the exact staleness the per-instance catalog
 * exists to fix. Size and mtime of each rule DLL move whenever its content
 * does.
 *
 * The file set mirrors what extract-bp-catalog.ps1 itself reflects over:
 * bin\*.dll whose name contains 'BestPractice', plus every DLL in
 * bin\BPExtensions. Measured on a real install that is 25 files, reached by
 * two readdirs and 25 stats in ~5 ms — this runs on every rebuild, so it has
 * to stay far cheaper than the multi-minute scan it decides against.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT cover: each model's AxRuleSet\BPRules.xml, the
 * source of the canonical names. Finding those means recursing the whole
 * packages root, which is most of the cost of the extraction itself. Neither
 * did the bin\ mtime it replaces, and in practice a platform update that
