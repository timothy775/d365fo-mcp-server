/**
 * Exact-match-first ranking for object searches.
 *
 * Defect #15 (2026-07-21 sweep): `search(type="edt", query="Num")` at limit=40
 * never surfaced the EDT `Num` — the result window was filled with `NumberOf*` /
 * `Numeric*` prefix hits. Neither backing search ranks by match quality:
 *   • the C# bridge scans provider primary keys in provider order and stops at
 *     `Results.Count >= maxResults` (MetadataReadService.SearchObjects), and
 *   • the SQLite path orders by FTS5 `rank`, which is a token-frequency score,
 *     not a name-equality score.
 * So a short exact name that happens to sort/enumerate late is invisible.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE NOTE: ranking here is pure in-memory work over an already-bounded
 * result window — it never widens a SQL query. The companion "the exact match
 * was outside the window" probe must stay index-safe; see
 * `lookupSymbolsNocase` in utils/symbolLookup.ts (exact-case probe on
 * idx_name_type, bounded FTS phrase fallback — never `LIKE` and never
 * `COLLATE NOCASE` as the primary predicate).

/**
 * Ranking that keeps exact-name matches first but additionally prioritizes
 * custom/ISV-model symbols directly after them, ahead of the far larger
 * Microsoft standard corpus.
 *
 * Motivation: a broad keyword fills the C# bridge's fixed result window
 * (`maxResults`) in provider-enumeration order, which is dominated by Microsoft
 * standard objects, so custom matches that enumerate later get truncated and
 * the search appears to "return only Microsoft objects". Surfacing custom hits
 * into their own band guarantees they are visible regardless of window size.
 *
 * Tiers (lower first):
 *   0 = exact name match (any model — an exact Microsoft hit still wins)
 *   1 = custom-model hit
 *   2 = everything else
 * Within a tier the name-quality rank and original order are preserved (stable),
 * so bridge/FTS relevance is untouched where it says nothing about equality.
