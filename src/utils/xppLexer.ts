/**
 * Shared X++ lexer-lite: the single place that knows where a string literal or a
 * comment starts and ends.
 *
 * Every keyword/regex scan in this repo runs against a *masked* copy of the source
 * so that a keyword inside a literal cannot fire a rule. Before this module there
 * were five independent maskers and two of them (validateXpp, xppSelectLint)
 * recognised only double-quoted strings. Measured on 7,649 shipped AOT files, that
 * single hole produced every error-severity false positive the validator had:
 *
 *   strFind(text, ',', 1, len)        → FN001 "expects 4 arguments" (the ',' counted)
 *   '????????-????-…' (a GUID mask)   → CS001 "?? is C#"
 *   ' LEFT JOIN %2 T2 ON …' (SQL)     → SEL007 "left join is not X++"
 *
 * X++ literal rules this implements (verified against xppc 7.0.7996.33):
 *  - "…" and '…' are both string literals; \ escapes the next character.
 *  - @"…" / @'…' are verbatim: the backslash is an ordinary character, the literal
 *    may span lines, and it ends at the next matching quote.
 *  - // to end of line, and /* … *\/ block comments (### and /// are ordinary text
 *    to the lexer; /// is a doc comment and callers that care about it check the
 *    prefix themselves).
 *
 * Masking preserves the byte length and every newline, so line numbers and offsets
 * taken from the masked text address the original source. Delimiters (the quotes,
 * the // and /*) survive; only the CONTENT becomes spaces, which is what lets a
 * rule still see that a call had a string argument at all.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a tokenizer and not a parser: rules stay regex-based
 * (see docs/XPP_LANGUAGE_COVERAGE_PLAN.md §4 "no AST").
