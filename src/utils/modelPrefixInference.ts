/**
 * Infer a model's object prefix from the objects that model already contains.
 *
 * Why this exists: `EXTENSION_PREFIX` is a single value chosen once, during
 * `setup`. Real development spans several models — a developer works in Demo
 * today and DemoCus tomorrow — and each of those carries its own prefix (DEMO_
 * and DMC_ respectively). A single configured value cannot be right for all of
 * them, and nobody is going to re-run setup on every context switch.
 * The information is already on disk: the model's existing objects state its
 * prefix far more reliably than any configuration does.
 *
 * So the active model's own naming wins, and the configured `EXTENSION_PREFIX`
 * becomes the fallback for models that have nothing to learn from (a brand-new,
 * empty model) — see resolveObjectPrefix() in modelClassifier.ts for the order.
 *
 * Two tokens are inferred, because D365FO uses two different forms and they are
 * NOT derivable from one another (DEMO_ / DEMO, but Con / Con):
 *   - `regular` — prepended to new objects and to members added inside an
 *     extension:  DEMO_MandatoryReasonCode, DEMO_ArchiveAccDocErrorLog
 *   - `infix`   — embedded in extension element/class names:
 *     AssetBookTable.DEMOExtension, AccountingSourceExplorerDEMO_Extension
 *
 * Inference is deliberately conservative: a model whose objects show no
 * consistent prefix yields null, and the configured value is used unchanged.
