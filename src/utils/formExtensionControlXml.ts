/**
 * Placement + serialization for a control added to an AxFormExtension.
 *
 * A form extension expresses a new control in one of TWO mutually exclusive
 * shapes, and which one is correct depends entirely on WHERE the parent lives:
 *
 *   1. Parent is a control of the BASE FORM → an <AxFormExtensionControl>
 *      envelope in the extension's ROOT <Controls>, carrying its own wrapper
 *      <Name>, the real control under <FormControl>, and a <Parent> reference:
 *
 *        <Controls>                                   ← root, child of AxFormExtension
 *          <AxFormExtensionControl xmlns="">
 *            <Name>FormExtensionControlfse38xiwz</Name>
 *            <FormControl xmlns="" i:type="AxFormCheckBoxControl"> … </FormControl>
 *            <Parent>Grid</Parent>
 *          </AxFormExtensionControl>
 *        </Controls>
 *
 *   2. Parent is a container THE EXTENSION ITSELF DEFINES → a bare
 *      <AxFormControl i:type="…"> in that container's NESTED <Controls>. No
 *      envelope and no <Parent>: the nesting already encodes parentage, so a
 *      <Parent> element there is meaningless.
 *
 *        <FormControl xmlns="" i:type="AxFormGroupControl">
 *          <Name>QualityOrders</Name>
 *          <Controls>                                 ← nested
 *            <AxFormControl xmlns="" i:type="AxFormCheckBoxControl"> … </AxFormControl>
 *          </Controls>
 *          <DataGroup>QualityOrders</DataGroup>
 *        </FormControl>
 *
 * The previous implementation built shape 1 unconditionally and spliced it in
 * with `content.replace('</Controls>', …)`. A string pattern replaces the FIRST
 * occurrence, and when the extension defines its own container the nested
 * </Controls> closes first — so the envelope landed inside the nested
 * collection, which is typed to AxFormControl. `parentControl` was never
 * resolved to a node at all; it only supplied the <Parent> text. The result was
 * well-formed XML in the wrong collection, reported as a success.
 *
 * This module resolves the parent against the extension's own control tree and
 * derives BOTH the representation and the insertion offset from where that
 * parent turns out to live. Pure and side-effect-free so it is trivially
 * testable — the file I/O stays in the caller.

/**
 * Advisory, deliberately NOT a refusal.

 * The base-form guard elsewhere refuses, and is right to: a base-form
 * <DataGroup> container has its members generated by the compiler, so an
 * explicit control for one of them collides ("The duplicate name … was
 * detected"). That reasoning does not carry over here. A group created by a form
 * EXTENSION renders exactly its explicit <Controls> list and nothing ever tops
 * it up (measured 2026-08-12: a field-group member with no explicit control does
 * not appear on the running form). So on an extension-owned parent the explicit
 * control is not a duplicate — it is the only thing that puts the field on the
 * form, and refusing would send the caller to the Visual Studio designer for the
 * one job this tool exists to do without it.
 *
 * What remains true is that the control has to AGREE with the field group, or
 * the build warns ("different fields from the field group … use restore on the
 * form control") and the next designer Refresh rewrites the collection from the
 * field group. That is worth saying every time and not worth blocking on —
 * whether the written control agrees cannot be answered without reading the
 * table's field group, which this pure function has no access to.
