/**
 * Removal of one control from an AxForm or AxFormExtension, in place.
 *
 * The inverse of insertFormExtensionControl (see formExtensionControlXml.ts) and
 * of the bridge's AddControl, and it has the same reason for existing as
 * directXmlDeleteAction: there is no C# operation for it, so the only way to
 * take a button off a form was d365fo_file(action="create", overwrite=true) —
 * rewriting the whole form from hand-authored XML, which loses every collection
 * the caller did not think to re-type.
 *
 * Two things make this more than a string replace:
 *
 *  1. Controls NEST. A button lives inside a ButtonGroup inside an ActionPane
 *     inside <Design>/<Controls>, and every level is another <Controls>. The
 *     target is found by walking the tree, not by matching a `<Name>` substring
 *     — the latter also matches data sources, data fields, the form's own
 *     <Name>, and every override method's <Name>.
 *
 *  2. A form EXTENSION expresses a control in two shapes (see
 *     formExtensionControlXml.ts): a bare <AxFormControl> nested under a
 *     container the extension owns, or an <AxFormExtensionControl> envelope in
 *     the extension's root <Controls> whose real control sits under
 *     <FormControl>. Deleting the <FormControl> out of an envelope leaves the
 *     envelope behind — a control-less wrapper with a <Parent> reference, which
 *     is not a shape the deserializer expects. The whole envelope goes.
 *
 * Separators: a toolbar button is almost always followed by an
 * <AxFormButtonSeparatorControl>, which exists only to space that button from
 * the next one. Removing the button and leaving the separator puts a stray
 * divider on the ActionPane, so `removeSeparator` drops the adjacent one too —
 * opt-in, because "adjacent separator" is a layout judgement and a separator
 * between two REMAINING buttons is load-bearing.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect-free; the file I/O stays in the caller.
