## Why

AI assistants excel at C#, Python, and JavaScript. X++ is different: your D365FO codebase is private, deeply customized, and invisible to every model — so AI confidently generates code that doesn't compile.

This server pre-indexes your entire D365FO installation (580 000+ symbols across standard, ISV, and custom models) and exposes it as 26 specialized MCP tools. Every signature, every CoC wrapper, every label, every form pattern — verified against your real metadata **before** the AI writes a single line.

![Solution Architecture](docs/img/solution-architecture-diagram.svg)

| Task | Without this server | With this server |
|------|--------------------|------------------|
| Method signatures | Guessed → compile errors | Exact, from your codebase |
| Existing CoC wrappers | Manual AOT search | `extension_info(mode="coc")` in < 50 ms |
| New forms | Hand-written XML, broken patterns | Cloned from reference forms, validated against the pattern catalog |
| Labels | Hardcoded strings | Right `@SYS`/`@MODULE` key found instantly |
| Security chains | Hours of manual tracing | Role → Duty → Privilege → Entry Point in one call |
| Generated code | Hallucinated fields and types | Every reference proven against the index, gated before write |

---

## Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Full-codebase intelligence** | 580K+ symbols indexed: classes, tables, forms, EDTs, enums, labels (20M+ rows), security artifacts — FTS5 search in < 10 ms |
| 🛡️ **Grounded generation** | Fail-closed gates: `prepare` issues grounding tokens, `validate_code(mode="references")` proves every identifier, `validate_code(mode="syntax")` enforces best practices — hallucinated code never reaches disk |
| 🧩 **Form pattern engine** | Complete catalog of Microsoft form patterns and sub-patterns: recommends the right pattern, clones reference forms with datasource re-binding, **deterministically expands** patterns that have no reference form, **auto-repairs** a form's missing required controls, validates structure and blocks invalid writes |
| ✍️ **Safe metadata writes** | C# bridge uses Microsoft's own `IMetadataProvider` wherever it can express the object; the few types and ops it cannot go through structured XML writers with ambiguity guards — never blind string replacement. Automatic `.rnrproj` registration, one-call undo |
| 🏗️ **SDLC integration** | MSBuild compilation with structured diagnostics, DB sync, xppbp best practices, SysTestRunner — all from chat |
| 📐 **X++ knowledge base** | Queryable rules: select grammar, CoC authoring, financial dimensions, the posting engine (`LedgerVoucher`), number sequences, `SysExtension`, Electronic Reporting, AX2012→D365FO migration — prevents deprecated APIs |

### Pattern-grounded form development

Forms are the hardest artifact to generate correctly — each pattern dictates required containers, ordering, and allowed sub-patterns. The form pattern engine makes it a guided pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["object_patterns<br/>(domain=form, action=analyze)"] --> B["object_patterns<br/>(domain=form, action=spec)"]
    B --> C["generate_object<br/>objectType=form, cloneFrom"]
    C --> D["object_patterns<br/>(domain=form, action=validate) FP001–FP010"]
    D -->|clean| E["d365fo_file<br/>(action=create) write + project"]
    D -->|errors| C
```

Structural violations (wrong order, missing container, disallowed control) **block the write** — recommendations only warn. Mined pattern statistics from your own environment ground every suggestion in reality.

## Quick Start

> **From D365FO platform update 10.0.49 (PU74), Visual Studio 2026 is the supported IDE for X++ development** — Microsoft no longer supports VS 2022. Earlier platform versions still use VS 2022 ≥ 17.14. [Details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/whats-new-platform-updates-10-0-49)

**Installing on your own D365FO VM** — the usual case. One line in PowerShell installs Node.js if it is missing, installs the server from npm, and runs the setup wizard, which asks where the index should live and builds the C# bridge for you:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynamics365ninja/d365fo-mcp-server/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Already have Node.js 24+? Then the one-liner has nothing to bootstrap and you can skip it:

```powershell
npm install -g d365fo-mcp
d365fo-mcp setup
```

Re-running either is safe. An installation made before the npm package existed is a git checkout, and both are left exactly where they are and updated in place.

**Your team already runs a shared server?** Then you install nothing — point your editor at it:

```powershell
npx d365fo-mcp connect https://your-server.azurewebsites.net
```

Both paths in full — prerequisites, editor configuration for every scenario, the required instruction file, and how to verify grounding actually works: **[docs/QUICK_START.md](docs/QUICK_START.md)**

## Azure Deployment

One shared instance for the whole team — the metadata index lives in Blob Storage and downloads automatically on startup.
