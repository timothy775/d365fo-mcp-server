# All Available Tools

When you ask GitHub Copilot a question about D365FO code, it automatically calls one of these
56 tools to look up the answer or generate code. You do not need to name the tools yourself —
just ask in plain English.

> **C# Metadata Bridge (Windows D365FO VMs only):** On a Windows VM with D365FO installed,
> 16 tools automatically try the C# metadata bridge first — providing always-fresh,
> runtime-resolved metadata via `IMetadataProvider` and compiler-resolved cross-references
> via `DYNAMICSXREFDB`. If the bridge is unavailable (Azure, Linux, CI) or the object is
> not found, the tools transparently fall back to the SQLite database.
> Bridge-sourced results include a `_Source: C# bridge_` marker.
>
> **Cross-reference enrichment:** `find_references` returns categorized reference
> types (call/extends/field-access) and caller details. `find_coc_extensions` shows which
> methods each extension class wraps. `find_event_handlers` supports eventName/handlerType
> filtering. `get_api_usage_patterns` returns compiler-resolved callers grouped by class.
>
> **Write operations** are fully bridged: 18 create types and **all 25 modify operations**
> use `IMetadataProvider.Create()` / `Update()` as the sole write path.
> The bridge is required for all modify operations (no xml2js fallback).
> Complex create types (report, data-entity) remain in TypeScript XML generation.
> See [BRIDGE.md](BRIDGE.md) for details.

## Quick Reference

### Workspace Configuration (1 tool)

> ⚠️ **Local-only** — excluded from `read-only` (Azure) mode; available in `full` and `write-only` modes.
> Reports server config loaded from `.mcp.json`, detected D365FO projects from `D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH`,
> and stdio session info (MCP client name, roots). On Azure this would return irrelevant cloud-server
> state rather than your developer workspace — use the local companion for this tool.

### File Operations — LOCAL_TOOLS (4 tools)

> The following tools access the **local Windows VM filesystem** (K:\ drive paths in
> `PackagesLocalDirectory` or `.rnrproj` project files) and are therefore excluded from
> the Azure `read-only` deployment. In the hybrid setup they run on the local companion
> (`MCP_SERVER_MODE=write-only`). They also skip the DB loading wait — no symbol database needed.

| Tool | Works where | What it does |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **generate_d365fo_xml** | Anywhere (cloud + local) | Returns XML content — Copilot then creates the file |
| **create_d365fo_file** | Local Windows VM only | Creates the physical file and adds it to the VS project |
| **modify_d365fo_file** | Local Windows VM only | Edits an existing file in place (applies immediately; optional `.bak` backup) |

| **find_event_handlers** † | All event handlers with type classification and event filtering | "Who handles the onInserted event of SalesLine?" |
| **get_table_extension_info** | All extensions of a table: added fields, indexes, methods | "What fields did ISV packages add to CustTable?" |
| **get_data_entity_info** † | Data entity category, OData name, data sources, keys | "Show me CustCustomerV3Entity details" |
| **analyze_extension_points** † | CoC-eligible methods, delegates, events — what can be extended (pass `showExistingExtensions=true` to also list existing wrappers/subscribers) | "What can I extend on SalesLine?" |
| **recommend_extension_strategy** | Recommends the best extensibility mechanism for a scenario — prevents wrong choices (CoC vs event vs Business Event vs data entity) | "Should I use CoC or Business Event to notify an external system?" |

| **validate_xpp** | Offline X++/XML BP validator — <50 ms, all-platform, no xppbp.exe needed. Returns `{rule, severity, line, excerpt, fix}[]`. Call after generating code, before write operations. | "Validate this generated class for BP issues" |
| **prepare_change** | Single-round context aggregator for extension work. Returns method signature, existing CoC wrappers, eligibility, strategy, naming validation, and a grounding token in one parallel call. | "Prepare context for extending CustTable.validateWrite" |

> **Grounding enforcement:** `prepare_change` issues a SHA-256 provenance token (30-min TTL). When `GROUNDING_ENFORCE=true` is set in `.env`, extension patterns in `generate_code` and extension objectTypes in `create_d365fo_file` require a valid token — ensuring generated code is grounded in your actual codebase, not AI training data.

## Tool Details

### search

Searches every indexed D365FO symbol (hundreds of thousands across standard + custom models). Understands type filters so you can narrow results.

**Supported types:** class, table, method, field, enum, edt, form, query, view, report

**Examples:**
```
Find classes related to sales invoice posting
Search for tables used in customer management
Find methods that calculate tax
Find fields named Invoice across all tables
Find EDT for ItemId
```

---

### batch_search

Runs multiple searches in a single call — about 3× faster than asking one by one.
Use it when you need information about several unrelated things at once.

**Examples:**
```
Find SalesTable, CustTable, and LedgerJournalTrans at the same time
Search for dimension classes, ledger services, and posting controllers
```

---

### search_extensions

Same as **search** but filters to only your custom/ISV code. Use this when you want to
avoid noise from the 500 000+ standard Microsoft symbols.

**Examples:**
```
Find all my ISV_ classes
Show me custom extensions for CustTable
Search for MyModel helper classes
```

---

### code_completion

Lists methods and fields available on a class or table, with optional name-prefix filtering.
Use this for lightweight symbol look-up when you already know the object name and want to see
what members are available — without fetching the full class definition.

> ℹ️ For full class details including method source code, use **get_class_info**.
> For full table schemas, use **get_table_info**.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `className` | Yes | Class or table name |
| `prefix` | No | Method/field name prefix to filter results |
| `includeWorkspace` | No | Also scan local workspace files (requires `workspacePath`) |
| `workspacePath` | No | Path to local workspace root for scanning |

**Examples:**
```
What methods start with 'calc' on SalesTable?
List all methods on LedgerJournalEngine
Show fields starting with 'Cust' on CustTable
```

---

### get_class_info

Returns the complete class definition: every method with its full signature and source code,
the inheritance chain (extends/implements), and any attributes.

**Examples:**
```
Show me all methods on CustTable
What does the SalesFormLetter class do?
Show me the full source of DimensionAttributeValueSet
```

---

### get_table_info

Returns the full table schema: every field with its data type and EDT, all indexes (including
which is the primary key), and every foreign key relation.

**Examples:**
```
What fields does SalesLine have?
Show me all relations on InventTable
What is the primary key of CustTable?
```

---

### get_enum_info

Returns all values of an enum with their integer values and labels. Use this for enums only.
For Extended Data Types (EDT), use **get_edt_info** instead.

**Examples:**
```
What values does SalesStatus have?
Show me all NoYes enum values
List values of InventTransType
```

---

### get_edt_info

Returns the complete Extended Data Type (EDT) definition including base type (Extends), enum type,
reference table, string/number constraints, labels, and all EDT properties from AxEdt metadata.

**Use this when you need:**
- Base type inheritance chain (which EDT extends which)
- Reference table and relation type
- String size, display length, number of decimals
- Label, help text, and form help references
- Configuration keys and other EDT properties

**Examples:**
```
Show me EDT properties for CustAccount
What is the base type of ItemId?
Show me the reference table for RecId EDT
What is the string size of Name EDT?
```

---

### get_method_signature

Extracts the exact signature of a method including modifiers, return type, and all parameters
with their default values. Essential before writing a Chain of Command extension — using the
wrong signature always causes a compilation error.

**Examples:**
```
Get the signature of SalesTable.validateWrite()
What parameters does InventTable.initFromTable() take?
```

---

### get_method_source

Returns the complete X++ source code of a method — the full implementation including all
conditions, loops, transaction handling, and error logic. Use this when the signature alone is
not enough and you need to understand what the method actually does.

The database stores the full body alongside the snippet, so no file I/O is needed at query time.
Falls back to the extracted JSON metadata when the database was built before this feature was added.

**Examples:**
```
Show me the full implementation of SalesTable.validateWrite()
What does InventUpd_Reservation.updateReservation() actually do?
Show me the posting logic in SalesInvoiceJournalPost.run()
```

---

### find_references

Performs a where-used search across the entire codebase. Works for classes, methods, tables,
fields, and enums.

**Examples:**
```
Where is DimensionAttributeValueSet used?
Find all callers of CustTable.validateWrite()
Which classes reference the SalesLine.RemainSalesPhysical field?
```

---

### get_query_info

Returns the complete query structure: all datasources, joins, field lists, and range definitions.

**Examples:**
```
Analyze CustTransOpenQuery
Show me joins in LedgerJournalTrans query
What ranges does InventOnHand query have?
```

---

### get_view_info

Returns view or data entity structure including fields (mapped and computed), relations,
primary key, and methods. Works for both AxView and AxDataEntityView objects.

**Examples:**
```
Show me GeneralJournalAccountEntryView structure
List fields and relations on CustomerV3Entity
What is the primary key of VendorV2Entity?
```

---

### get_report_info

Reads an AxReport XML file from disk and returns structured information about its contents.
Use this **instead of PowerShell `Get-Content`** when studying an existing SSRS report before
creating a similar one or extending it.

Reports are indexed as type `report` in the symbol database, so you can also find them
with `search(query, type: 'report')`.

**Parameters:**
- `reportName` — AxReport object name without `.xml` extension (required)
- `modelName` — model name; auto-detected from `.mcp.json` if omitted
- `includeFields` — include per-dataset field list (default: `true`)
- `includeRdl` — include full embedded RDL XML (default: `false`; can be large)

**Returns:**
- Report name, model, file path
- DataMethods and EmbeddedImages presence
- For each **DataSet**: name, `DataSourceType`, query (`SELECT * FROM DP.TmpTable`),
  field names + aliases + data types, field groups
- For each **Design**: name, caption, linked DataSet, style, whether RDL is present
- Optional RDL summary (element counts, Tablix/Chart count, ReportParameters, language)
  or the full RDL XML when `includeRdl: true`

**Examples:**
```
Show me the dataset fields of the InventValue report
What does the ContosoInventByZone report look like — datasets and design?
Find reports related to fixed assets
```

---

### get_form_info

Parses form XML and returns all datasources (with their fields and methods), the control
hierarchy (buttons, grids, groups), and form-level methods.

When you need to find the **exact name** of a tab, group, or field to use in a form extension,
pass `searchControl` with a case-insensitive substring (e.g. `searchControl="General"`).
The tool returns matching controls with their full path, parent name, and children — so you
know exactly where to place new controls without resorting to PowerShell.

> ❌ **Never use PowerShell `Get-Content` / `Select-String` to search form XML.**
> ✅ **Always use `get_form_info(formName, searchControl="...")` instead.**

**Parameters:**
- `formName` — form name (required)
- `searchControl` — substring to find controls by name; returns path + parent + children
- `includeControls` / `includeDataSources` / `includeMethods` — toggle sections (default: all on)

**Examples:**
```
Show me the datasources in SalesTable form
Find the exact name of the General tab in CustTable form
What controls are inside the LineView tab of SalesTable?
List all buttons on the CustTable form
What methods does the SalesCreateOrder form have?
```

---

### get_d365fo_error_help

Diagnoses D365FO X++ compiler errors, BP warnings, and runtime exceptions. Returns a
plain-language explanation plus a corrective action — no symbol-index access needed, so
it works in both Azure read-only and local modes.

**When to call:** Whenever the compiler Output window, Error List, or runtime infolog shows
an unfamiliar error. The system instructions mandate calling this tool **before guessing
a fix** (see `xpp_system_instructions` MCP prompt / `src/prompts/systemInstructions.ts`).

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `errorText` | Yes | Full error text — paste from Error List, Output window, or infolog |
| `errorCode` | No | Error code prefix, e.g. `CSUV1`, `SYS10028`, `BPError` — improves matching |
| `context` | No | X++ code snippet where the error occurs — produces a more targeted suggestion |

**Covered error families:** CSUV\*/CSU\*, SYS\*, BP\* warnings, TTS-level errors,
OCC (UpdateConflict), type-cast errors, "must call next", "not valid metadata element", and more.

**Examples:**
```
get_d365fo_error_help(errorText="CSUV1 The field CustAccount cannot be assigned", errorCode="CSUV1")
get_d365fo_error_help(errorText="BPUpgradeCodeToday")
get_d365fo_error_help(errorText="TTS level is not 0", context="ttsbegin; ... ttscommit;")
```

---

### get_xpp_knowledge

Queryable knowledge base of D365FO X++ patterns, best practices, and AX2012→D365FO migration
guidance. Returns distilled, verified patterns with code examples. Call BEFORE generating code
to avoid deprecated APIs and AX2012 anti-patterns.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `topic` | Yes | Topic to query — e.g. "batch job", "ttsbegin", "RunBase vs SysOperation", "CoC", "temp tables" |
| `format` | No | `concise` (default) = quick reference, `detailed` = full explanation with code examples |

**Topics covered:** batch jobs, transactions, queries, CoC/extensions, event handlers, security,
data entities, temp tables, number sequences, form patterns, set-based operations, error handling,
labels, SSRS reports, deprecated APIs, performance, testing.

**Examples:**
```
How to create a batch job in D365FO?
What replaced RunBase in D365FO?
Show me transaction handling patterns (detailed)
Is today() deprecated? What should I use instead?
How does CoC work? Show code examples
```

---

### analyze_code_patterns

Analyzes your actual codebase to find the most common classes, methods, and dependencies
used in a given scenario. Use this before generating code to make sure Copilot follows
your team's real patterns, not generic templates.

**Examples:**
```
Analyze patterns for ledger journal creation
What are the common patterns for helper classes in my code?
Show me patterns for financial dimension handling
```

---

### suggest_method_implementation

Finds real examples of how similar methods are implemented in your codebase and generates
an X++ method skeleton based on method-name heuristics. Call this before writing a method
from scratch to ground the implementation in proven patterns.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `className` | Yes | Class that will contain the method |
| `methodName` | Yes | Name of the method to implement |
| `returnType` | No | Return type of the method (default: `void`) |
| `parameters` | No | Array of `{ name, type }` parameter objects |

**Examples:**
```
How do others implement validateWrite() on a sales-related table?
Show me similar implementations of calcDiscount() with return type AmountMST
Generate a skeleton for processPayment() returning boolean
```

---

### analyze_class_completeness

Checks a class against similar classes in the codebase to identify standard methods it
is missing. Useful for ensuring a new class is fully implemented before review.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `className` | Yes | Name of the class to analyze |

**Examples:**
```
Is MyHelper class complete?
What standard methods is MySalesService missing?
Analyze completeness of ContosoInvoiceController
```

---

### get_api_usage_patterns

Shows how a specific API class or method is actually used in your codebase: typical
initialization code, common method call sequences, and related APIs.

> **Bridge-first:** When the C# bridge is connected, this tool queries
> `DYNAMICSXREFDB` for compiler-resolved callers of the API, grouped by class with
> method list and call count. Falls back to SQLite pattern analysis when the bridge
> is unavailable.

**Examples:**
```
How do I correctly use DimensionAttributeValueSet?
Show me how LedgerJournalEngine is typically initialized
How is InventDim used in my code?
```

---

### generate_code

so the generated code matches your environment.

**Supported patterns:**

| Pattern | Use it for |
|---------|-----------|
| `class` | Standard X++ class (also the base for CoC extensions) |
| `runnable` | Class with `main()` for direct execution or one-off scripts |

---

### create_d365fo_file

Creates a physical D365FO XML file in the correct AOT location on a local Windows VM.
The server reads your `.rnrproj` to determine the model name automatically — so the file
always ends up in your custom model, not a Microsoft standard model.

Optionally adds the file to your Visual Studio project in one step.

When the package name differs from the model name, pass `packageName` explicitly
(e.g., `CustomExtensions`). In UDE environments, the server resolves it automatically
from descriptor XML files. In traditional environments, it defaults to the model name.

**Supported object types:**

| Type | AOT folder | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `class` | `AxClass` | Regular X++ class |
| `class-extension` | `AxClass` | `[ExtensionOf(classStr(...))] final class` skeleton |

| `kpi` | `AxKPI` | AxKPI XML (Measure, MeasureDimension, Goal, GoalType) |

**Requires:** MCP server running on a local Windows machine with file system access.

**Examples:**
```
Create a class MyHelper and add it to my project
Create a table extension for InventTable in my model
Create a class in the CustomExtensions package, Contoso Utilities model
Create the SSRS report XML for ContosoMyReport in my model
```

### generate_d365fo_xml

Returns the D365FO XML content as text. Works everywhere — Azure, local, any OS.
Copilot then writes the content to a file using VS Code's file tools.

Supports the same object types as `create_d365fo_file`: class, table, form, query, view,
data-entity, enum, edt, **report**.

Use this when the MCP server is hosted in Azure and does not have local file system access.

---

### modify_d365fo_file

Edits an existing D365FO XML file:

1. Makes the change (add/edit/remove a method or field) via IMetadataProvider
2. Validates that the XML is still well-formed
3. Optionally writes a `.bak` first when `createBackup=true` (default: `false`)

> ⚠️ **Applies immediately — there is no dry-run/preview mode.** The change is written
> to disk the moment the tool is called. Describe the intended change in chat and let the
> user confirm *before* calling. To revert, use `undo_last_modification` (git checkout) or
> pass `createBackup=true` to keep a `.bak` copy. Failures are returned with `isError=true`.

Supports `packageName` parameter for when the package name differs from the model name.
In UDE environments this is auto-resolved; in traditional environments it defaults to
the model name.

**Supported operations:**

| Operation | Applies to | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `add-method` | class, table, form, extension | Add a new method (or CoC method). Pass full X++ source via `sourceCode`. |
| `remove-method` | class, table | Remove a method by name. |

---

### search_labels

Performs full-text search across all indexed AxLabelFile labels. Searches label IDs, text
content, and developer comments simultaneously. Returns labels in ranked order with ready-to-use
`@LabelFileId:LabelId` reference syntax.

> **Always call this before `create_label`** — reusing an existing label avoids duplication
> and saves translation effort.

**Parameters:**
- `query` — text to search for (required)
- `language` — filter by locale, e.g. `en-US` (default: `en-US`)
- `model` — restrict to one model, e.g. `MyModel`
- `labelFileId` — restrict to one label file ID
- `limit` — max results (default: 30)

**Examples:**
```
Find a label for the text "customer account"
Search for labels about "batch" in the MyModel model
Find labels matching "vendor" in English
```

---

### get_label_info

Has two modes depending on whether you pass a label ID:

**Mode A — list label files** (no `labelId`): Shows all AxLabelFile IDs available in a
model, the languages they contain, and how many labels each file has.

**Mode B — show translations** (with `labelId`): Shows all language translations for a
specific label, including the developer comment, and generates ready-to-use X++ and XML
code snippets.

**Examples:**
```
What label files does the MyModel model have?
Show me all translations of label MyFeature in MyModel
Show me the X++ snippet for label BatchGroup
```

---

### create_label

Adds a new label to every language `.label.txt` file in a model (or only the locales given in
`languages`). Inserts the entry alphabetically (as required by the D365FO label file format),
creates the AxLabelFile XML descriptors if the model doesn't have any yet, and updates the MCP
index so the new label is immediately searchable.

> **Always call `search_labels` first** to verify the label doesn't already exist.

> **Note — `LabelResources/` is shared across the whole model.** By default the label is written
> to *every* locale folder present in the model, even folders that exist only because a sibling
> label file (e.g. a multi-language report) ships them. For a customization that needs just one
> language, pass `languages: ["en-US"]` to avoid creating empty placeholder files for the others.

**Parameters:**
- `labelId` — new label ID, e.g. `MyNewField` (required)
- `labelFileId` — target label file, e.g. `MyModel` (required)
- `model` — model name, e.g. `MyModel` (required)
- `translations` — array of `{ language, text }` objects (required); provide all supported
  languages
- `languages` — restrict which locale `.label.txt` files are written/created, e.g. `["en-US"]`.
  When omitted/empty, writes to every language folder already present in the model (default)
- `defaultComment` — developer comment added to each translation
- `packageName` — package name for label file location; auto-resolved from model if omitted
- `packagePath` — override base path (default: auto-detected from environment)
- `createLabelFileIfMissing` — create AxLabelFile structure from scratch if needed
- `updateIndex` — immediately update the MCP index (default: `true`)

**Label reference syntax after creation:**
- In X++ code: `literalStr("@MyModel:MyNewField")`
- In metadata XML: `<Label>@MyModel:MyNewField</Label>`

**Examples:**
```
Create label MyNewField in the MyModel model with translations for en-US, cs, de, and sk
Add a new label CustomerAccountNumber with English text "Customer account number"
```

---

### rename_label

Renames a label ID everywhere it is used across the model — a single command that handles
all three locations atomically:

1. **`.label.txt` files** — the label entry is renamed in every language variant
2. **X++ source files (`.xpp`)** — all `@LabelFileId:OldId` references are replaced
3. **XML metadata files** — all `<Label>`, `<HelpText>`, `<Caption>`, etc. properties
   that reference the old label ID are updated
4. **MCP SQLite index** — updated so the new ID is immediately searchable

> ⚠️ **Always run with `dryRun=true` first** to preview the full impact before writing
> any files.

**Parameters:**
- `oldLabelId` — current label ID (required)
- `newLabelId` — new label ID, alphanumeric (required)
- `labelFileId` — label file that owns the label, e.g. `MyModel` (required)
- `model` — model name (required)
- `packageName` — package name; auto-resolved if omitted
- `packagePath` — override base path; auto-detected if omitted
- `searchPaths` — additional directories to scan for X++ / XML references
- `dryRun` — preview mode, no files written (default: `false`)
- `updateIndex` — update MCP index after rename (default: `true`)

**Examples:**
```
Rename label OldFieldName to NewFieldName in label file MyModel, model MyModel (dry run first)
Rename label MyOldCaption to MyNewCaption in MyModel
```

---

### suggest_edt

Suggests Extended Data Types (EDT) for a field name using fuzzy matching and pattern analysis.
Analyzes indexed EDT metadata to recommend appropriate EDTs based on field name patterns.

**Use this BEFORE creating table fields** to ensure you reuse existing EDTs instead of
creating primitive types.

**Parameters:**
- `fieldName` — field name to suggest EDT for (required), e.g. "CustomerAccount", "OrderAmount"
- `context` — optional context to improve suggestions, e.g. "sales order", "ledger journal"
- `limit` — max suggestions to return (default: 5)

**Examples:**
```
What EDT should I use for field CustomerAccount?
Suggest EDT for OrderAmount in sales order context
What EDT matches TransDate field name?
```

**Returns:**
- Confidence-ranked EDT suggestions (1.0 = exact match, 0.8+ = high confidence)

### verify_d365fo_project

Verifies that D365FO objects exist on disk at the correct AOT path and are referenced in the Visual Studio project file. Use this instead of PowerShell after `create_d365fo_file` to confirm that files were created and registered correctly.

**Parameters:**
- `objects` (required): Array of `{ objectType, objectName }` pairs to check
- `projectPath` (optional): Absolute path to `.rnrproj` — required for project-reference check
- `modelName` (optional): Model name — auto-detected from `mcp.json` if omitted
- `packageName` / `packagePath` (optional): Override auto-resolved package location

**Returns:** Markdown table with ✅/❌ for each object on disk presence and project inclusion, plus a summary.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "objects": [
    { "objectType": "table",            "objectName": "ContosoInventByZoneTmp" },
    { "objectType": "report",           "objectName": "ContosoInventByZone" },

### build_d365fo_project

Triggers an MSBuild / xppc.exe compilation of the D365FO model. Repeated calls poll the
running job and return the latest log output — no need to re-invoke separately to check status.

> ⚠️ **LOCAL_TOOLS only** — requires a local Windows VM with D365FO installed.
> Never call this automatically — only on explicit user request.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `modelName` | No | Model name to build; auto-detected from `.mcp.json` if omitted |
| `projectPath` | No | `.rnrproj` path (used only to extract model name if `modelName` omitted) |
| `force` | No | Kill any stuck build process and restart (default: `false`) |

**Examples:**
```
Build my project and show me the errors
Build the ContosoRobotics model
Force-restart the stuck build
```

---

Returns a pass/warning/error summary and raw BP output.

> ⚠️ **LOCAL_TOOLS only** — requires a local Windows VM with D365FO installed.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `modelName` | No | Model name to check; auto-detected from `.mcp.json` if omitted |
| `projectPath` | No | `.rnrproj` path; auto-detected if omitted |

### run_systest_class

Invokes the D365FO SysTest framework against a specific test class (and optionally a single
test method). Uses SysTestRunner.exe when available, falling back to xppbp.exe.

> ⚠️ **LOCAL_TOOLS only** — requires a local Windows VM with D365FO installed.

**Parameters:**

---

### update_symbol_index

Re-indexes a D365FO XML file in the SQLite symbol database. Since `create_d365fo_file`
and `modify_d365fo_file` now **auto-invalidate** the Redis cache and refresh the C# bridge
provider, this tool is no longer required after those operations. It remains useful for
edge cases — files modified outside MCP tools (manual edits, `git pull`, external scripts).

**Handles three scenarios:**

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **File exists** (created/modified) | Re-parses the XML file, updates all symbol entries in SQLite (symbols + labels), and **invalidates Redis cache** for all affected objects |
| **File deleted** | Removes all stale symbol and label entries from SQLite, clears Redis cache entries (`xpp:class:*`, `xpp:table:*`, `xpp:method-sig:*`, `xpp:search:*`), and refreshes the C# bridge provider |
| **File not in index** | Indexes the file for the first time |

> **Why this matters:** Without cache invalidation, Redis would continue serving stale data
> (e.g. a deleted class appearing as "found") until the 1-hour TTL expired. This tool now
> clears all relevant cache entries immediately.

**Parameters:**
- `filePath` — absolute path to the D365FO XML file (required)
- `objectType` — object type hint: `class`, `table`, `enum`, `edt`, etc. (optional)

**Returns:**
- `✅ Indexed N symbol(s)` — file was (re-)indexed, Redis cache invalidated
- `🗑️ File deleted — cleaned up N symbol(s) + M label(s)` — stale entries removed

**Examples:**
```
Update the index for the new class I just created
Re-index SalesTable after adding a field
The index still shows a label I deleted — force re-index
```

---

### undo_last_modification

Reverts or deletes an uncommitted D365FO file change via git, then performs **full index
cleanup** to ensure the MCP symbol database reflects the actual state on disk.

**For tracked files** (modified, existing in git):
1. Runs `git checkout HEAD -- <file>` to restore the last committed version
2. Removes stale symbol/label entries from SQLite
3. Invalidates Redis cache for all affected objects
4. Refreshes the C# bridge provider
5. Re-indexes the restored file to reflect its reverted content

**For untracked files** (newly created, not in git):
1. Deletes the file from disk (`fs.unlinkSync`)
2. Removes stale symbol/label entries from SQLite
3. Invalidates Redis cache entries
4. Refreshes the C# bridge

> **Why this matters:** Previously, undoing a file creation left the symbol index believing
> the objects still existed — Copilot would report classes and labels as valid even after
> they were removed. Now the entire cleanup chain runs automatically.

**Parameters:**
- `filePath` — absolute path to the D365FO XML file to undo (required)

**Returns:**
- Success message with details about the revert/delete and index cleanup
- Error message if the file is not in a git repository or has no changes

**Examples:**
```
Undo the changes I just made to CustTable.xml
Revert the new class I just created — it was wrong
Delete the untracked label file and clean up the index
```

---

### review_workspace_changes

Fetches all uncommitted X++ changes via `git diff HEAD` from a local repository and formats
them as a clean diff for AI-based code review against D365FO best practices.

> ⚠️ **LOCAL_TOOLS only** — requires a local Windows machine with the repository checked out.
> This tool is NOT a substitute for `run_bp_check` — it performs AI-driven diff analysis,
> while `run_bp_check` runs the real Microsoft xppbp.exe linter.

**Parameters:**
- `directoryPath` — absolute path to the local git repository (required)

**Returns:**
- Formatted git diff of uncommitted changes ready for AI code review
- Empty message if there are no uncommitted changes

**Examples:**
```
Review my uncommitted changes against D365 best practices
Check the git diff in K:\repos\MyProject for code quality issues
```

---

### get_workspace_info

Returns the currently configured model name, package path, project path, and environment type.
Explicitly flags whether the model name looks like a placeholder (`MyModel`, `MyPackage`, etc.).

When a placeholder is detected, the tool auto-reads the `.rnrproj` file and shows the real
auto-detected model name as a concrete fix suggestion.

> ⚠️ **Always call this at the start of every D365FO session.** If it reports a placeholder,
> stop and fix `.mcp.json` before creating any files — without the correct model name, new
> objects will land in the wrong model.

On UDE / Power Platform Tools environments, D365FO splits metadata into two roots: a writable
custom root (`Package path`, from `ModelStoreFolder`) and a read-only Microsoft root
(`Framework dir`, from `FrameworkDirectory`). Both are reported so callers can resolve symbols
across either tree, but file creation must always target the package path.

**Takes no parameters.**

**Returns:**
- Model name (from `.mcp.json`) and whether it is a placeholder
- Package path (custom metadata root) and project path
- Framework directory (Microsoft metadata root) — UDE only; empty on classic VMs
- Environment type (`ude`, `traditional`, or `azure`)
- If placeholder: the real model name auto-detected from `.rnrproj` + exact fix instruction

**Example:**
```
Check my D365FO workspace configuration
What model am I working in?
```

---

### get_security_artifact_info

Returns full details for a security privilege, duty, or role including the complete
hierarchy chain: role → duties → privileges → entry points (forms, tables, menu items).

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Name of the security artifact |
| `artifactType` | Yes | `privilege`, `duty`, or `role` |
| `includeChain` | No | Walk and display the full hierarchy (default: `true`) |

**Examples:**
```
Show me everything in the CustTableFullControl privilege
What duties does the TradeSalesClerk role include?

### analyze_extension_points

Analyzes an X++ class, table, or form and returns all available extension surfaces:
CoC-eligible methods, delegates, standard events, and (optionally) existing wrappers and
subscribers already present in the codebase.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `objectName` | Yes | Class, table, or form name to analyze |
| `objectType` | No | `class`, `table`, `form`, or `auto` (default: `auto`) |
| `showExistingExtensions` | No | Also list existing CoC wrappers and event subscribers (default: `false`) |

```

---

### recommend_extension_strategy

Rule-based advisor that recommends the best D365FO extensibility mechanism for a described
goal — preventing wrong choices such as CoC where a Business Event or data entity is more
appropriate. Returns the recommended strategy, reasoning, risks, alternatives,
anti-patterns to avoid, and suggested next MCP calls.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `goal` | Yes | Plain-English description of what you want to achieve |
| `objectName` | No | Target D365FO object, if known |
| `scenario` | No | One of: `data-validation`, `field-defaulting`, `business-logic-change`, `outbound-integration`, `inbound-data`, `ui-modification`, `document-output`, `number-sequence`, `security-access`, `batch-processing`, `custom`. Auto-detected from `goal` if omitted. |

**Examples:**
```
Should I use CoC or Business Event to notify an external system?
How should I default a field value when a new sales order is created?
What is the best way to add a custom field to the vendor invoice form?
```

---

### validate_object_naming

Validates a proposed D365FO object name against naming conventions and detects conflicts
in the symbol index. Supports both `prefix` and `model-name` extension naming styles
(controlled by `EXTENSION_NAMING_STYLE`).

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `proposedName` | Yes | The full object name to validate |
| `objectType` | Yes | Object type: `class`, `table`, `form`, `enum`, `edt`, `query`, `view`, `table-extension`, `class-extension`, `form-extension`, `enum-extension`, `edt-extension`, `menu-item`, `security-privilege`, `security-duty`, `security-role`, `data-entity` |
| `baseObjectName` | Extension types | Name of the base object being extended (required for all `*-extension` types) |
| `modelPrefix` | No | Expected ISV/model prefix (2-4 uppercase letters, e.g. `"CR"`, `"WHS"`). Auto-detected from the symbol index if omitted. |
| `modelName` | No | Target model name. Relevant only when `EXTENSION_NAMING_STYLE=model-name`, where the extension token is the model name instead of the prefix infix (e.g. `CustTable_ContosoRobotics_Extension`). Auto-detected from the active workspace config if omitted. |

**Extension naming styles:**

| Style | Class extension | Element extension |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| `prefix` (default) | `{Base}{Prefix}_Extension` | `{Base}.{Prefix}Extension` |
| `model-name` | `{Base}_{ModelName}_Extension` | `{Base}.{ModelName}` |

**Examples:**
```
Is SalesTableCR_Extension a valid extension class name for SalesTable?
Validate CustTable.ContosoRoboticsExtension as a table-extension
Validate CustTable_ContosoRobotics_Extension as class-extension with modelName="ContosoRobotics"
```

## Tips

**You never need to name tools directly.** Just describe what you want:

- "Show me..." → uses get_class_info or get_table_info
- "Find..." → uses search or find_references
- "Create..." → uses analyze_code_patterns + generate_code + create_d365fo_file
- "Extend..." → uses get_method_signature + generate_code
- "Generate a table..." → uses get_table_patterns + generate_smart_table
- "Generate a form..." → uses get_form_patterns + generate_smart_form
- "Create an SSRS report..." → uses get_report_info + generate_smart_report

**Be specific for best results:**
- Vague: "Find customer stuff"
- Better: "Find methods on CustTable for updating the credit limit"

**For CoC extensions, always get the signature first:**
```
Get the signature of CustTable.validateWrite()
Now create a CoC extension that adds credit limit validation
```

**For creating tables/forms, analyze patterns first:**
```
Show me common patterns in Transaction tables
Now generate a transaction table with those patterns
```

**Be specific for best results:**
- Vague: "Find customer stuff"
- Better: "Find methods on CustTable for updating the credit limit"

**For CoC extensions, always get the signature first:**
```
Get the signature of CustTable.validateWrite()
Now create a CoC extension that adds credit limit validation
```
