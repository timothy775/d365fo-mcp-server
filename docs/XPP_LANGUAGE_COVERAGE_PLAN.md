# X++ language & reporting coverage — plan v2.1 (2026-08-30, verified against xppc 7.0.7996.33)

**Status: G0–G5 and G-VM are DONE** on branch `feat/xpp-compiler-verified`. All nine authored
cases were run on the VM and their goldens captured; core coverage is back to **100% (59/59)**,
this time on goldens that exist. Every language claim in this document was checked against the
**compiler and the shipped source**, not against Microsoft Learn — the X++ reference is
incomplete and parts of it still describe AX 2012.

The G4 leftovers are closed too: `report-dataset-extension`, `report-custom-design` and
`report-menu-redirect` are now generator patterns AND catalog recipes, with all four emitted
shapes compiled on the VM. What remains is one thing, and it is not a code change — see
**The SysTest blocker** below.

## Implementation status (2026-08-30)

| Phase | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| G0.6 compiler-facts snapshot | **done** | `scripts/capture-compiler-facts.ts` → `eval/compiler-facts.snapshot.json` → `src/knowledge/compilerFacts.generated.ts`, ratchet `tests/knowledge/compilerFacts.test.ts` |
| G0.4 validator false positives | **done** — 5 error-severity FPs → **0** on 7,649 shipped files | shared lexer `src/utils/xppLexer.ts`; COC001/002/003, TTS001, BP001, SEL001, SEL002, `lintXppSelect` |
| G0.5 FN001 from the compiler table | **done** — 170 run-time functions + 80 intrinsics with min/max, plus FN002 | `checkBuiltinArity` |
| G0.3 knowledge corrections | **done** | the entries in §2, plus `display static` (which an earlier probe had wrongly cleared) |
| G0.1 coverage claims | **done** — 6 leaves re-pointed, 3 stale notes fixed, note gate widened | `src/eval/coverage/taxonomy.ts` |
| G2 new rules | **done** — BP006, MAC001, SEL008, SEL009, SEL010, ATTR001, ATTR002, EXT001, KW001, CS001 expansion | all silent on shipped code |
| G1 knowledge pack | **done** — `runtime-functions`, `form-event-handlers`, `args-object`, `display-edit-methods`, `sysoperation-ui-attributes`, `report-extension-patterns` | every named API compiled in a probe first |
| G3 TDD / SysTest | **done** — `pattern="systest"` (compiles clean in the sandbox), `prepare(mode="test")`, per-method result parsing, `/unattended` | |
| G4 reporting extension patterns | **done** — knowledge, plus 3 generator patterns and 3 catalog recipes; all four emitted shapes compiled on the VM with a negative control | `codeGen.ts`, `reportPatterns/catalog.ts`, `tests/tools/reportExtensionScaffold.test.ts` |
| G5 taxonomy expansion + cases | **done** — 9 leaves, 9 authored cases, coverage 100% → **86.4% core** honestly | |
| G5 → G-VM golden capture | **done** — nine cases run on the VM, 15 golden files, coverage 86.4% → **100% core**; three defects found and fixed on the way | `eval/goldens/L2-*`, `eval/goldens/L3-*`, `eval/corpus/runs/2026-08-30T14__*` |

### The SysTest blocker was misdiagnosed

Four cases (`L2-coc-extension`, `L2-event-handler-basic`, `L3-batch-basic`,
`L3-enum-field-form-downgrade-guard`) still carry `systest_pending`, and the reason recorded for
it was wrong. `SysTestConsole.exe` stops at `Login failed for user 'AOSUser'`, which this repo
read as a rotated deployment credential. Nothing has rotated.
`PackagesLocalDirectory\Bin\SysTestConsole.exe.config` is the **shipped template, never
configured for this machine**, and it disagrees with the AOS's own `WebRoot\web.config` — which
sits on the same disk and works — on **all four** DataAccess settings:

| setting | SysTestConsole.exe.config | web.config (the working one) |
|---|---|---|
| `DataAccess.Database` | `AxDbRain` | `AxDB` |
| `DataAccess.SqlUser` | `AOSUser` | `axdbadmin` |
| `DataAccess.DbServer` | `.` | the real host name |
| `DataAccess.SqlPwd` | `$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$` | an 828-character encrypted blob |

The fix is to copy those four across, keeping a backup beside the file — the same class of
config-only change as the two that made the runner start in the first place. It was **not made
here**: it edits the platform install and moves a secret between files, so it is the owner's call.
**Tracked as its own topic**, not as part of this plan: nothing in the repo can close it, and the
four cases stay `systest_pending` until someone applies it on the machine.
`run_systest_class` now performs the comparison itself and reports which settings differ, never
printing the password (only "the shipped placeholder" or "set, N chars"), so the next reader is
not sent hunting a password that was never wrong.

### What the CAPTURE changed — three defects no repo test could see

Running the cases found three things that producing well-formed XML and passing 5,383 tests had
hidden. Each one only fails inside xppc, and each one fails on the **wrong object**:

- **`d365fo_file(create, table)` silently dropped `properties.fieldGroups`.** The `<FieldGroups>`
  block was a hardcoded literal holding only the five `Auto*` groups. A table with no groups of its
  own still builds clean, so it surfaced one step later as
  `Metadata Error: AxForm/…/Grid/DataGroup: Field group 'Overview' does not exist` — on the FORM.
- **`d365fo_file(create, form)` never resolved field control types.** Every grid column came out
  `AxFormStringControl`; the date column then failed with `DataField: Data type mismatch`. The
  templates have accepted a `fieldTypes` map all along and `generate_object` supplies one — only
  this builder did not. It now resolves them off disk, which also covers a table written moments
  earlier in the same call and therefore absent from the symbol index.
- **The knowledge base was wrong about `CancelSuperCall`.** `form-event-handlers` said to call
  `_e.CancelSuperCall()`; xppc answers *"Class 'FormControlEventArgs' does not contain a definition
  for 'CancelSuperCall'"*. The args have to be narrowed to `FormControlCancelableSuperEventArgs`
  first. Rule, example and the audit allowlist are corrected.

A fourth was in the plan's own case specs: `L2-display-edit-methods` asked for an
`AxTableExtension`, and an `AxTableExtension` carries no `<Methods>` element at all — not one
shipped table extension in ApplicationSuite has one. Display and edit methods on a table you do not
own belong in an `[ExtensionOf(tableStr(…))] final class`. The case was corrected to match.

### What the compiler changed about the plan

Five things the plan proposed were **dropped or inverted** once xppc answered:

- a generics rule — `List<str>` fails in a sandbox model, but that is a *resolution* failure
  ("Are you missing a module reference?"), not a syntax one, and ApplicationSuite ships it.
- `*=` and `/=` as C#-isms — they compile (57 and 2 shipped uses).
- flagging every select expression on a buffer — one named after its table resolves as the table.
- EVT001 — the compiler already answers "cannot be used as an event handler … because the parameter
  profile does not match", clearly and at the right moment.
- `display static` — an EARLIER probe of mine cleared it, and it was wrong: the probe's method name
  did not match its XML entry, so the body was never compiled. It is "Conflicting modifiers
  'static display'". A probe that reports nothing is not the same as a probe that passed.

Three blockers this repo had recorded turned out to be wrong or incomplete:

- **SysTestConsole is not interactive-only.** `/unattended` skips the debugger prompt.
- Two assembly faults then stopped it, both fixed here by CONFIG edits with backups: the
  ApplicationInsights redirect named a version the install lacks (assembly version is 2.23.0.29, not
  the file version 2.23.0.00029), and System.ValueTuple 4.0.3.0 was absent from Bin but present in
  `ModelUtilDlls`, which is now on the `<probing privatePath>`. The runner now reaches the AOS
  database and stops at `Login failed for user 'AOSUser'` — a deployment credential, left alone.
- **"You can't extend RDP classes"** is design guidance: a CoC wrapper on
  `SrsReportDataProviderBase.processReport` compiles.

## 1. Compiler facts the server must encode (contradicting docs, knowledge or v2)

### 1.1 Lexical / keywords
- Reserved (115): includes `having`, `foreach`, `async`, `await`, `namespace`, `using`, `var`, `const`, `readonly`, `internal`, `byref`, `unchecked`, `firstonly1`, `hint`, `breakpoint`, `print`, `flush`, `eventhandler`, `delegate`. **Not** keywords: `window`, `pause`, `tablelock`, `changesite`, `at`, `this`. `in` is *exempted* (usable as identifier).
- `having` / `namespace` / `async` / `foreach` are reserved but **not implemented** (`having` → "'join' expected"; `foreach` → "')' expected"; `namespace X {}` → "';' expected").
- `window 10,10;` → "Invalid token '10'"; `pause;` → "Invalid token ';'"; `tableLock T;` → "does not denote a class, a table, or an extended data type"; `changeSite(1){}` → "';' expected". `print 'x';`, `breakpoint;`, `flush T;` compile (shipped use: print 13/2 files, flush 103, breakpoint 0).
- `#define X(1)` without the dot → "The macro 'define' is not defined" (the word is parsed as a macro *reference*). `#globaldefine`, `#globalmacro…#endmacro`, `#defInc`/`#defDec`, `#linenumber`, `#undef`, `#ifnot`, `%1` params, `#localmacro` all compile; shipped use of `#globaldefine`/`#defInc` is **0**.
- A `#define` macro is a legal attribute argument (`[SysObsolete(#Msg)]`); a `const` or an expression is not ("Invalid token ','" / "Invalid token '('").
- `@identifier` escape (161 shipped uses), `@'verbatim'` (2,359), hex `0xFF` (211), exponent literals (3), date literals (3,787), utcdatetime literals (44) all compile.

### 1.2 Types & conversions (docs are wrong here)
| Assignment | Compiler |
|---|---|
| `int i = 1.5;` (real→int) | **ERROR** "loses range and precision" (docs claim implicit truncation) |
| `int64 l = 1.5;` | warning "loses precision" |
| `int64 l; int i = l;` | warning "loses range" |
| `int i = today();`, `date d = 1;` | ERROR |
| `str s = 1;`, `str s = true;`, `str s = NoYes::Yes;`, `int i = 'a';` | ERROR (no implicit to/from str) |
| `str s = "a" + 1;` | ERROR "Types 'str' and 'int' are not compatible with operator '+'" |
| `real r = 1; int i = NoYes::Yes; NoYes e = 1; boolean b = 1; int i = true; int64 l = 1;` | OK |
| `utcdatetime + int` | ERROR; `date ± int`, `date - date` OK; utcdatetime comparisons OK |
| `if (str)`, `if (real)`, `if (container)`, `if (buffer)`, `if (object)`, `if (guid)` | OK (truthiness) |
| `anytype a = 1; a = 'x';` | compiles (the "locks to first type" claim is run-time, unverified) |
| `int i == null` | ERROR "operands of type 'int' and 'nulltype'" |
| `uint`, `bool`, `decimal`, `double`, `long`, `string`, `List<int>` | ERROR "does not denote a class, a table, or an extended data type" |
| arrays `int a[10]`, `real r[100,5]`, `int d[]`, `str 10 n[3]` | OK (memory-size form has 0 shipped uses) |
| CLR array indexing `arr[0]` | ERROR "…Use the SetValue and GetValue methods on managed array types" |

### 1.3 Operators & statements
- `*=` and `/=` **compile** (57 and 2 shipped uses) — the docs' "only `= += -= ++ --`" is wrong. `int y = i++;` → "';' expected" (increment is a statement); `++i;` as a statement compiles.
- `default:` must be the **last** case ("A default part must be the last case item"). Non-constant `case y:`/`case y + 1:` compile; `switch (container)` compiles; `case 'a':` on str compiles.
- `for (int i = 0, j = 0; …)` compiles. Shadowing → exact text "A local variable named 'i' cannot be declared in this scope because it would give a different meaning to 'i', which is already used in a parent or current scope to denote something else."
- `var x;` → "The implicitly typed variable 'x' requires a value to be assigned to it"; `var` field → "Invalid token 'var'".
- `readonly` field assigned in a method → "The field 'R' is read only…"; `const` → "The const field 'K' cannot be changed."
- Local functions may be declared **after** statements (compiles; docs/knowledge say "at the top").
- `using (System.IO.StringReader r = …) { }` and `using (var r = …)` **compile** (8,306 shipped uses / 3,278 files). `dotnet-interop` R9 ("X++ has no using STATEMENT") is wrong.
- `throw;` (bare rethrow) compiles only in a catch ("Rethrow statements … can only be used in catch blocks"; 1,018 shipped uses). `throw new System.X(...)` compiles (169 uses).
- Typed CLR catch needs a **declared variable**: `System.ArgumentException ex; … catch (ex)` compiles (2,002 uses); inline `catch (System.Exception ex)` → "')' expected".
- `finally` must follow all catches; a bare `catch` before a typed catch makes the latter unreachable (warning). `retry;` outside catch → error; `break;` outside loop/switch → error; `this` in static → "Variable 'this' is not found in scope".
- `unchecked(Uncheck::X) { }` — members that exist: `TableSecurityPermission` (228 uses), `XDS` (235). `DBSchemaDrift`, `Deadlock` do not.
- `Exception::` values that compile: Error, Warning, Info, Deadlock, UpdateConflict, UpdateConflictNotRecovered, DuplicateKeyException, DuplicateKeyExceptionNotRecovered, CLRError, Numeric, Internal, Break (warning "Do not use this exception. It is reserved."), Sequence, DDEerror, CodeAccessSecurity, Timeout, TransientSqlConnectionError; shipped code also uses ViewDataSourceValidation (32), FunctionArgument (23), NoValidRunnableCode, MethodNotFound, PersistentSqlConnectionError. **Not** a value: PassClrExceptionsToApplication.
- `client`/`server` modifiers compile with **deprecation warnings** ("The 'Client' keyword has been deprecated…") — not silently ignored; only `NumberSeq` still carries them.
- `protected internal` compiles (419 uses) and `internal protected` too; `private protected` → "Conflicting modifiers"; `override`/`virtual` → "';' expected"; two methods with one name → fatal "The name 'f' denotes a method, and cannot be reused".
- Extension-method classes are **enforced**: "Extension class 'X_Extension' must be static and public or internal", "The method 'bad' must be declared as static because it is declared in a static class", "The first parameter of a public extension method must be a class or a table…". Nested classes → "Nested classes are not allowed". `abstract` method in concrete class → error. Default param before required → "Non-default parameter '_b' cannot follow default parameters".
- Attribute arity is checked: `[SysObsolete("m")]`, `("m", false)`, `("m", false, 1\1\2026)` compile; four args → "The wrong number of arguments is specified for the method".

### 1.4 Data access
- `select` find options all compile: firstOnly/10/100/1000/**1** (450 uses), firstFast, noFetch, repeatableRead, optimisticLock, pessimisticLock, forceNestedLoop, forceSelectOrder, forcePlaceholders, **forceLiterals** (57 uses in 19 Microsoft files → "avoid", not "forbidden"), generateOnly, reverse, `index hint X`, plain `index X`, outer/exists/notexists join, aggregates with `group by` then `where`.
- `order by`/`group by` must precede `where` **within a join segment**: `select cg where … order by f` → "'join' expected"; `… where … join t order by t.f where …` is legal (7,145 vs 381 shipped shapes).
- `crossCompany` accepts `: variable`, `: [literal]` (8 shipped uses) and `: (expr)` — `multi-company` R5 is wrong. `join crossCompany t` → "Invalid token 'crossCompany'" (SEL003 correct).
- **`in` operator**: right side must be a container **variable** ("Container literals in 'in' expression are not supported. Declare container variable instead."); left side must be an **enum** field — str, int64, real, date fields fail with "Types 'str(…)' and 'container' are not compatible with operator 'in'"; Set/List rejected. Works in `select`, `while select … join`, `update_recordset`. `select-statement` R6 (str/int/…/date) is wrong.
- Select expression needs the **table name**: `(select firstonly CustGroup).Name` compiles; `(select firstonly cg).Name` → "Table 'cg' is not found" (5,604 shipped uses).
- `validTimeState(x)` / `(from, to)` take **variables/literals only** — `validTimeState(DateTimeUtil::utcNow())` → "Invalid token '::'".
- `join … on` → "Invalid token"; `left outer join` → "Invalid token 'outer'"; `having` → "'join' expected".
- `update_recordset firstonly …`, `delete_from t;` without where, `ttscommit;` without begin, `next cg;` without select, `while select cg stmt;` without braces all **compile** (run-time concerns only).
- `insert_recordset dst (f1, f2) select f1, f2 from src`, `update_recordset … setting … join …`, `RecordInsertList`, all six `skip*` methods (`skipDataMethods`, `skipDatabaseLog`, `skipEvents`, `skipAosValidation`, `skipDeleteActions`, `skipDeleteMethod`), `allowIndexHint`, `queryTimeout`, `executeQueryWithParameters` compile / are shipped.

### 1.6 Intrinsics (compiler table, 80) — the server's two lists must be replaced by this one

### 1.7 Testing API (read from `ApplicationFoundation/AxClass`, not TestEssentials)
- `SysTestCase extends SysTestAssert`: `setUp`, `setUpTestCase` (201 shipped overrides), `tearDown`, `tearDownTestCase`, `createSuite`, `parmExceptionExpected(boolean, msg, isRegEx)`, `exceptionExpected`, `expectedInfoLogMessage`, `assertExpectedInfoLogMessage`, `parmFaultExpected`, `useSingleInstance`, `testMethods`, `run`.
- `SysTestAssert`: `assertEquals assertNotEqual assertEquivalent assertNotEquivalent assertTrue assertFalse assertNull assertNotNull assertSame assertNotSame assertObjectEquals assertRealEquals assertUTCDateTimeEquals fail`. **No** `assertExpectedException` — expected exceptions use `parmExceptionExpected` (65 shipped uses).
- Suites: `SysTestSuite`, `SysTestSuiteCompanyIsolateClass`, `SysTestSuiteCompanyIsolateMethod`, `SysTestSuiteCompIsolateClassWithTts`, `SysTestSuiteTTS`, `SysTestSuiteNoCleanup`, `SysTestSuiteActor`, `SysTestSuiteProvider`. No `…CompanyIsolateShared`.

- ATL: `AtlDataRootNode::construct()` is the only entry; navigation is extension methods per module package — real chain from `AtlSampleTests/CostingSampleTest`: `data.invent()/.cust()/.sales()/.ledger()/.cost()/.prod()/.dimensions()`, `invent.items()/.onHand()/.sites().default()/.warehouses().default()/.postings()`, `items.bomStandardCostBuilder().setCostGroup(…).create()`, `data.cust().customers().default().record()`, `sales.salesOrders()`, `ledger.mainAccounts()`. Packages: AtlFoundation (29 classes), AtlCoreFinancial, AtlCostAccounting, AtlMaterialhandling, AtlPersonnel, AtlWarehouseOrders, ATLApplicationSuite, ATLTestCaseCommon, ATLGlobalizationLTM, AtlSampleTests.

## 2. Knowledge-base corrections required (entry · rule · evidence)

| Entry | Claim today | Verdict | Correct fact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dotnet-interop` R9 | "X++ has no `using` STATEMENT" | **WRONG** | compiles; 8,306 shipped uses. Teach `using (…) { }` for IDisposable |
| `dotnet-interop` R2 | put CLR calls in a `server` static method | **WRONG (AX2012)** | `server` compiles with a deprecation warning; everything runs on the server tier |
| `dotnet-interop` R7 | index CLR arrays with `get_Item()/set_Item()` | OVERSTATED | compiler text: "Use the SetValue and GetValue methods on managed array types" |
| `dotnet-interop` R4 | only `catch (Exception::CLRError)` | INCOMPLETE | typed catch via declared variable `catch (ex)` (2,002 uses) |
| `select-statement` R6 | `in` works with str/int/int64/real/enum/boolean/date/utcDateTime | **WRONG** | enum fields only; container must be a variable (literal rejected) |
| `select-statement` R7 | `forceLiterals` is FORBIDDEN | OVERSTATED | compiles; 57 Microsoft uses → "avoid; SQL-injection risk with user input" |
| `select-statement` R1 | option list | INCOMPLETE | add `generateOnly`, `firstOnly1`; select expression requires table name |
| `select-statement` R15 | `validTimeState(dateFrom, dateTo)` | INCOMPLETE | arguments must be variables/literals, not expressions |
| `multi-company` R5 | crossCompany list "must be a variable, not an inline literal" | **WRONG** | `crossCompany:[…]` (8 uses) and `crossCompany:(expr)` compile |
| `switch-loops` R7 | `client`/`server` "parsed but IGNORED" | OVERSTATED | compile with deprecation warnings |
| `switch-loops` R2 | `default:` optional | INCOMPLETE | and must be the last case item |
| `xpp-class-rules` R17 | local functions "at the top of a method body" | OVERSTATED | may follow statements |
| `xpp-class-rules` R4 | modifier order `[access][static…]` | OVERSTATED | `internal protected` also compiles; `display static` compiles |
| `xpp-data-types` R6/R7 | conversions list; anytype locking | INCOMPLETE | add the implicit-conversion table (§1.2): real→int is an ERROR |
| `operators-precedence` | (implicit) only `= += -= ++ --` | INCOMPLETE | `*=`, `/=` compile (57/2 uses) |
| `attributes-authoring` R2/R7 | literal-only; `SysObsolete(msg, makeError)` | INCOMPLETE | a `#define` macro is allowed; `SysObsolete` takes 1–3 args (3rd = date); xppbp `BPCheckSysObsoleteAttributeParametersMismatch` wants all three |
| `attributes-authoring` R6 | `getAttributedClasses` on DictClass/DictMethod | PARTLY | it is **static** `DictClass::getAttributedClasses(classStr(X))` (shipped: BusinessEventsCatalogHelper); `SysDictClass::getAttributedClasses` does not exist |
| `error-handling` R4 | Exception list | INCOMPLETE | add TransientSqlConnectionError, DDEerror, CodeAccessSecurity, ViewDataSourceValidation, FunctionArgument; Break is reserved; bare `throw;` rethrow; catch order rule |

| `testing`/`unit-testing` | assert names, `SysTestCase` location, suites | PARTLY | see §1.7: `parmExceptionExpected` not `assertExpectedException`; `SysTestCase` is in ApplicationFoundation; suite list; `SysTestRow` exists; `SysTestCaseAutoRollback` does not |
| `ssrs-rdp-preprocess` | `…PreProcessInterface` has only cleanUp/initialize/parm* | CONFIRMED | + `disableLockEscalation`, TempDB variant adds take/releaseOwnershipOfTempTable |

## 3. Validator — measured false positives on shipped code (7,649 files)

| Rule | Sev | Hits (classes) | Verdict | Root cause / fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FN001 | error | 7 | **FP** | `strFind(x, ',', 1, len)` — the masker ignores `'…'` literals, the comma inside `','` is counted as an argument. Fix the masker (§4.5) |
| CS001 | error | 1 (16 hits) | **FP** | `'????????-????-…'` inside a single-quoted string |
| SEL007 | error | 1 | **FP** | `' LEFT JOIN %2 T2 ON …'` inside a single-quoted SQL string |
| COC001 | error | 20 | **FP** | fires on *new* methods with default params in an `[ExtensionOf]` class (`findByJobId(…, boolean _forUpdate = false)`); must apply only to wrappers that call `next` |
| COC002 / COC003 | error | 3 / 1 | **FP** | 3-line lookahead after `[ExtensionOf]` reads the `/// <summary>` comment; and `public static class X_Extension` (extension-method class) is not a CoC class → exempt static classes, scan masked text |
| SEL002 | error | 2 | over-severe | Microsoft uses `forceLiterals` (57×) → warning |
| SEL001 | error | 1 | over-severe | `today()` is a BP finding, not a compile error → warning |
| BP001 | error | 12 | FP + over-severe | `EventSource.Info("…")` method calls named Info; hard-coded text is a BP warning, not an error |
| TTS001 | warning | 21 | noise | branch-dependent begin/commit counts (`ttsbegin × 7, ttscommit × 6`) |
| TTS002 | warning | 5 | doubtful | shipped code catches `Exception::Error` inside tts (dead code per docs, but compiles) |
| SEL005 | warning | 402 (1,221 hits) | noise | method calls in `where` are ubiquitous (`.name()`, `parmId()`); keep only for real functions |
| SEL004 | warning | 124 | noise | "≥2 while select, no join" heuristic |
| SEL006 | warning | 73 | noise | `allowIndexHint` is called elsewhere |
| BP002 | warning | 138 | legit advisory | `doUpdate()` |
| lintXppSelect | modify-path | 41 classes | **FP** | flags the joined table's own `where` after `join` (`while select … order by Name exists join x where …`) — standard X++ |
| TTS003, BP003, BP004, BP005, RPT002, COC006 | warning | ≤77 | mostly legit | |

Conclusion: 5 error-severity rules produce false positives on Microsoft's own code, all but two through the single-quote masking hole; three more are wrongly `error` for what the compiler accepts.

## 4. Merge rules (unchanged from v2, plus one)

1–10 as in v2 (extend never duplicate; ≤1,300 chars; no contradictions; rule-or-knowledge; **no AST but one shared lexer**; one intrinsics table; schema-byte ratchet; eval-first; snapshot gate; deferrals to BACKLOG).
11. **Compiler-truth gate.** A fact enters knowledge, a validator rule or a generator template only with an oracle reference: a keyword/intrinsic from the compiler tables, an arity from a probe message, a shape from the census, or a member from the class XML. `eval/compiler-facts.snapshot.json` (new, G0.6) holds these facts; tests read it instead of hand-typed constants.

---

## 5. Work plan (v2.1)

### G0 — Truth first (repo-only, ~1.5 days)
| # | Item |
|---|---|
| G0.1 | Re-point weak coverage leaves (`set-based` → `L2-performance-set-based`; `transactions` → tts/OCC cases; `select-grammar` += SysDa/date-effective/changeCompany; `menu-item` += display/action cases; `enum-extension` += `extensible-enums`); coverage rule: `runtime`-tagged leaves need `systest.ran` |
| G0.2 | Pattern-enum parity test; publish or drop the 6 hidden patterns |
| G0.3 | **Knowledge corrections of §2** (one PR, each rule cites its oracle) |
| G0.4 | **Validator FP fixes of §3**: shared lexer with `'…'`/`"…"`/`@…`/doubled quotes/`//`/`/* */`/`#`; COC001 only when the method body calls `next`; COC002/003 on masked text + static-class exemption; SEL002/SEL001/BP001 → warning; BP001 requires a *global* `info/warning/error/checkFailed(` (not `.Info(`); lintXppSelect rewritten (a `where` after `join` is legal); TTS001 downgraded to "count differs by >1" or removed |
| G0.5 | FN001 → min/max table from §1.5 (`date2Str` 7–8, `datetime2Str` 1–2, `fieldId2Name` 2–3, `error` 1–3, `runAs` 4–7, `con2Str` 1–2, `str2Con` 1–3, `strLFix` 2–3); add the fixed-arity families (`intv*`, financial, `char2Num` 2, `num2Str` 5, `time2Str` 3, `str2Date/Datetime/Enum` 2, `strKeep/strRem/strPrompt/strLine/strCmp/match` 2, `strPoke` 3); variadic list (`strFmt max min conIns conFind conPoke`); unknown-name list |
| G0.6 | `scripts/compiler-facts.ts` (VM): dumps keywords + intrinsics by reflection and runs the arity probe corpus → `eval/compiler-facts.snapshot.json`; `tests/knowledge/compilerFacts.test.ts` asserts FN001/KW/intrinsic tables equal the snapshot |
| G0.7 | BACKLOG entries for v1 deferrals; orphans claimed |

### G1 — Language knowledge pack v2 (repo-only, ~2 days)
New: `runtime-functions` (§1.5 catalog by category, with the do-not-exist and obsolete lists), `implicit-conversions` (or fold §1.2 into `xpp-data-types`), `form-event-handlers` (4 attributes, 4 enums with the members in §1.8, signatures `FormRun sender, FormEventArgs e` etc.), `args-object`, `display-edit-methods`, `sysoperation-ui-attributes` (existing classes: `SysOperationGroup/GroupMember/RootGroup/DisplayOrder/HelpText/ControlVisibility/JournaledParameters/AlwaysInitialize/CountryRegionCodes`, `SysOperationInitializable.initialize()`).
Extend: `xpp-declarations` (`@`, arrays, `byref`, multi-assign, local-function placement, `for` multi-init), `error-handling` (§1.3 list, rethrow, typed catch, finally/catch order, SQL timeouts), `dotnet-interop` (corrections), `switch-loops` (default-last, `*=`/`/=`, `window/pause/tableLock/changeSite` gone), `macros`, `xpp-class-rules`, `attributes-authoring`, `multi-company`, `select-statement` (`in` semantics, select-expression form, validTimeState args, clause order per join segment), `intrinsic-functions` (compiler list).

### G2 — Validator v2 (repo-only; messages already verified, ~2 days)
| Rule | Sev | Shape (compiler text) |
|---|---|---|
| lexer + intrinsics table | — | §4.5/4.6; intrinsics from `compiler-facts.snapshot.json` |
| KW001 | error | identifier ∈ 115-word set (`having`, `foreach`, `namespace`, `async`, `await` included) |
| MAC001 | error | `#define X` without dot → "The macro 'define' is not defined" |
| DOC001 | error | bare `&`/`<` in `///` (xppbp BPXmlDocMalformed) |
| DECL001 | error | shadowing (exact message §1.3) |
| OP001 | warn | mixed `&&`/`\|\|` without parens |
| SEL008 | error | `order by`/`group by` after `where` **in the same join segment** ("'join' expected") |
| SEL009 | error | `in` with a container literal / non-enum field (§1.4 texts) |
| SEL010 | error | select expression on a buffer variable; `validTimeState(` with an expression |
| SET001 | warn | `update_recordset`/`delete_from` without `where` |
| ATTR001 | error | non-literal attribute argument (const/expression; macros allowed) |
| ATTR002 | warn | `[SysObsolete]` with < 3 args (BP moniker) |
| EXT001 | error | `*_Extension` without `[ExtensionOf]`: not static, non-static method, first param not class/table (compiler texts §1.3) |
| CONV001 | error | `int x = <real expr>` and the other §1.2 ERROR rows (`str = int`, `int = str`, `date = int`, `str = enum/boolean`, `str + int`) |
| CS001 | error | keep `$"` `=>` `foreach` `??` `string`; add `bool decimal double long uint List<`, `override`, `virtual`, `private protected`, `catch (System.X ex)` inline, `goto`; **do not** add `*=`/`/=` |
| BP004 | warn/error | `window`/`pause`/`tableLock`/`changeSite` → error (not keywords); `print`/`breakpoint` warn |
| resolver | — | kernel allow-list (`Uncheck{TableSecurityPermission,XDS}`, `Exception` values §1.3, `Types`, `DictClass`, `Array`, `DbBackend`, `CodeAccessPermission`, `XppPrePostArgs`, `DataEventArgs`, `ValidateEventArgs`, `FormEventArgs`, `FormControlEventArgs`, `Args`, `FormRun`); optional-param-aware arity |

### G3 — TDD / SysTest pack (repo + VM, ~3 days)
- Knowledge `systest`: §1.7 verbatim (class location, lifecycle, assert list, `parmExceptionExpected`, suite list, attribute list, `TestEssentials` reference for Category/Owner/Priority); `atl-navigation` from `AtlSampleTests` chains; `tdd-workflow`.
- `generate_object(pattern="systest")`, `prepare(mode="test")`, `run_systest_class` XML parsing, ConPTY experiment (time-boxed), cases `L2-systest-authoring-basic`, `L2-systest-row-data-driven`, `L3-atl-sales-order-reservation`, `L2-tdd-red-green-cycle` — as in v2.

### G4 — Reporting pack v2 (repo + VM, ~3 days)
As in v2, with the API lists of §1.8 as the only allowed member names; RPT003 (TempDB pairing) now verifiable; EVT001 (`XppPrePostArgs` param) / EVT002 (static subscriber) — kernel types go through the resolver allow-list.

### G5 — Taxonomy expansion + eval authoring (repo-only, ~2 days) — as in v2 (16 leaves, 16 pending cases) plus `implicit-conversions` and `in-operator` cases.

### G-VM — capture (VM, ~1.5 days): knowledge-audit snapshot (already clean), `compiler-facts` snapshot, ConPTY, `eval-run` of pending cases, coverage regen, §6.4 review, delete this file.

### G6 — Platform-drift watch: monthly; re-run `compiler-facts` after every platform update (the keyword/intrinsic tables and arities are version-bound).

---

## 6. Probe list — resolved

All 20 v2 probes were run; results are in §1. Still open: P9 (bridge vs TS writer disagreement on `&amp;` in `///`), P13 (ConPTY), P16 (`[PostHandlerFor]` wrong parameter → compile vs runtime), P17 (CoC on an RDP class). New: `in` with an `int` field (only enum/str/int64/real/date probed), `anytype` re-assignment at run time.

## 7. Schema budget ledger — unchanged from v2 (no new tool; enum values + op-specs; trim `labels`).

## 8. Risks & non-goals — unchanged, plus: the compiler facts are bound to **xppc 7.0.7996.33 / 10.0.4x**; the snapshot records the version.

## 9. PR slicing
1. `fix(knowledge,validate): G0 — compiler-verified corrections, lexer, FP fixes, compiler-facts snapshot`
2. `feat(knowledge): G1 — language pack v2`
3. `feat(validate): G2 — 14 rules from compiler diagnostics`
4. `feat(test): G3` · 5. `feat(reports): G4` · 6. `feat(eval): G5` · 7. `feat(eval): G-VM` (deletes this file)
