/**
 * Verify the write in the call that made it.
 *
 * The conventional loop was create → verify_d365fo_project → run_bp_check: two
 * extra round trips per object, both asking questions the writing call already
 * had the answers to.
 *
 * The negative case is the one that earns its keep: this project has a
 * documented history of writes that report ✅ and leave nothing usable behind
 * (empty security objects, tables with no fields, files absent from the
 * .rnrproj). A success message that has actually looked at the disk is a
 * different claim from one that has not.
 *
 * But a false alarm costs more than no alarm. The first version of this check
 * resolved the .rnrproj `Content Include` against the project directory and
 * compared it to the absolute .xml path, and the fixture below used to make
 * that work: project and metadata in one tree, `.xml` in the Include. Neither
 * holds in a real installation — projects live in a repo, metadata under
 * PackagesLocalDirectory, and Includes are extensionless — so the check was
 * false on every write. Twelve such warnings in one session taught the agent to
 * disregard the warning, and it then disregarded the true one. The fixture is
 * now the real layout, and the tests below are what the old fixture hid.
