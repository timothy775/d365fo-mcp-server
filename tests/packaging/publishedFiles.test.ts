/**
 * What the published tarball must and must not contain.
 *
 * `npm i -g d365fo-mcp` is a full installation: the CLI runs the setup wizard,
 * builds the C# bridge and rebuilds the metadata index from the package
 * directory, with no checkout and no devDependencies to fall back on. Every
 * file those steps need therefore has to survive `npm pack` — and `files`
 * entries override .gitignore, so it is just as easy to publish something that
 * should never leave the machine.
 *
 * The list is computed with `npm pack --dry-run`, which is the same code path
 * `npm publish` uses, rather than by re-implementing npm's include rules here.
 *
 * That makes the suite a check on *build output*: almost everything published
 * comes from dist/, so an unbuilt tree packs a near-empty tarball and every
 * assertion below fails for a reason that has nothing to do with packaging.
 * It is skipped rather than failed in that case — `vitest` on a fresh clone is
 * a reasonable thing to do, and a wall of red teaching people to ignore this
 * suite is worse than not running it. CI builds before testing, so the gate is
 * always live where it decides anything.
