/**
 * Tool-schema token budget — a regression ratchet on the cost of the ListTools
 * payload, which is sent to the model on (at least) every new session and is
 * the server's largest fixed token cost.
 *
 * Rationale: the 23 tool schemas are verbose on purpose (the descriptions encode
 * hard-won D365FO patterns that prevent failed/retried calls), so the goal is
 * NOT to minimise blindly — it is to make the size *visible and bounded* so it
 * cannot creep upward unnoticed. Lower these ceilings whenever the schema is
 * trimmed; raise them only deliberately (e.g. a new tool), the same way
 * toolInventory.test.ts guards the tool *count*.
 *
 * Measured against the REAL serialized payload (not the source), because that
 * is what the client bills. We pull the registered `tools/list` handler off the
 * constructed server rather than standing up a transport — the handler ignores
 * its request/extra args, so a direct call returns the exact wire payload.

// ~4 chars/token is the usual rough conversion for English+JSON; only used for
// the human-readable log line, never for assertions.
const CHARS_PER_TOKEN = 4;

// Ceilings in characters of serialized JSON.
//
// Ratcheted down hard by issue #825: `d365fo_file` (9,888 -> 4,781) and
// `generate_object` (8,602 -> 3,135) stopped inlining a discriminated union of
// every operation and its parameters. Both now publish the DISCRIMINATORS only
// — action/objectType/operation/mode/pattern as closed enums — and the
// parameter contract behind the one the agent picks is fetched once from
// get_knowledge(kind="op-spec"), backed by d365foFileOpSpecs.ts and
// generateObjectOpSpecs.ts. get_knowledge paid ~490 chars for that lookup.
//
// What is left in those two schemas is close to the floor: the two closed enums
// in d365fo_file alone are ~1,185 chars, and the remaining prose is the
// behavioural warnings (immediate apply, isError=false, never hand-build the
// prefix) that stop failed calls — which cost far more than the bytes do.
//
// Ratcheted again by the round-trip work, which needed headroom it did not have:
// 53,450 of 53,500 chars were used, and `labels` sat 3 chars under its per-tool
// cap, so no change could be paid for. Three trims, ~3,850 chars:
//   • get_method and suggest_edt unpublished. Both were folded into a tool that
//     already had the object in hand — get_object_info(options.method) and
//     prepare(fieldsHint) — and get_method's mandated chain (search →
//     get_object_info → get_method) spent a round trip to read one signature.
//     Their handlers stay routable, so an agent holding the old name still gets
//     an answer instead of an unrecoverable "unknown tool".
//   • `labels` write plumbing — 13 knobs (packagePath, languages, sortLabels, …)
//     that are auto-resolved on the normal path — moved behind
//     get_knowledge(kind="op-spec", topic="labels"), the same trade #825 made
//     for d365fo_file. labels: 6,197 -> 4,465.
//   Net after re-spending some of it on the folded get_method contract: 53,450 -> 49,776.
//   • the 23-value object-type enum was inlined THREE times in `search`; the two
//     nested copies now point at the top-level one.
//
// Raised DELIBERATELY, by 451 chars, to spend part of that headroom on
// d365fo_file's operations[] (4,781 -> 5,232): several edits to one object in a
// single call. This is the trade the trim was for — the description costs ~450
// chars once per session, and it removes six or more round trips from every
// ordinary table change, each of which re-bills the entire cached context.
//
// Raised again by ~200 chars for prepare's `operation`, which makes prepare
// return the write contract itself. Deferring those contracts out of the schema
// (#825) had traded bytes for a discovery hop — get_knowledge(kind="op-spec")
// on nearly every write flow — and this buys the hop back for a fraction of
// what inlining them cost.
//
// Headroom is small on purpose so creep is caught early: both ceilings are the
// next round hundred above the measured payload.
//
// Phase 1.7 (reader payloads) added ~50 chars to get_object_info's `options`
// description to name the new pagination knobs — table fieldsOffset/fieldFilter
// and form maxControls. That is not optional text: a knob the model cannot see
// does not shrink anything, so those chars buy back thousands per call. Against
// main alone it needed the ceiling at 53_700; combined with the Phase 1.5 trim
// it fits far below, so the ceiling is set from the real measured payload.
