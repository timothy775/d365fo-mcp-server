/**
 * Tool-schema token budget — a regression ratchet on the cost of the ListTools
 * payload, which is sent to the model on (at least) every new session and is
 * the server's largest fixed token cost.
 *
 * Rationale: the 20 tool schemas are verbose on purpose (the descriptions encode
 * hard-won D365FO patterns that prevent failed/retried calls), so the goal is
 * NOT to minimise blindly — it is to make the size *visible and bounded* so it
 * cannot creep upward unnoticed. Lower these ceilings whenever the schema is
 * trimmed; raise them only deliberately (e.g. a new tool), the same way
 * toolInventory.test.ts guards the tool *count*.
 *
 * Measured against the REAL serialized payload (not the source), because that
 * is what the client bills. We pull the registered `tools/list` handler off the
 * constructed server rather than standing up a transport — the handler ignores
 * its request/extra args, so a direct call returns the exact wire payload.

const CHARS_PER_TOKEN = 4;

// Ceilings in characters of serialized JSON.
//
// Ratcheted down hard by issue #825: `d365fo_file` (9,888 -> 4,781) and
// `generate_object` (8,602 -> 3,135) stopped inlining a discriminated union of
// every operation and its parameters. Both now publish the DISCRIMINATORS only
// — action/objectType/operation/mode/pattern as closed enums — and the
// parameter contract behind the one the agent picks is fetched once from
// get_knowledge(kind="op-spec"), backed by d365foFileOpSpecs.ts and
// generateObjectOpSpecs.ts. get_knowledge paid ~490 chars for that lookup.
//
// What is left in those two schemas is close to the floor: the two closed enums
// in d365fo_file alone are ~1,185 chars, and the remaining prose is the
// behavioural warnings (immediate apply, isError=false, never hand-build the
// prefix) that stop failed calls — which cost far more than the bytes do.
//
// Ratcheted again by the round-trip work, which needed headroom it did not have:
// 53,450 of 53,500 chars were used, and `labels` sat 3 chars under its per-tool
// cap, so no change could be paid for. Three trims, ~3,850 chars:
//   • get_method and suggest_edt unpublished. Both were folded into a tool that
//     already had the object in hand — get_object_info(options.method) and
//     prepare(fieldsHint) — and get_method's mandated chain (search →
//     get_object_info → get_method) spent a round trip to read one signature.
//     Their handlers stay routable, so an agent holding the old name still gets
//     an answer instead of an unrecoverable "unknown tool".
//   • `labels` write plumbing — 13 knobs (packagePath, languages, sortLabels, …)
//     that are auto-resolved on the normal path — moved behind
//     get_knowledge(kind="op-spec", topic="labels"), the same trade #825 made
//     for d365fo_file. labels: 6,197 -> 4,465.
//   Net after re-spending some of it on the folded get_method contract: 53,450 -> 49,776.
//   • the 23-value object-type enum was inlined THREE times in `search`; the two
//     nested copies now point at the top-level one.
//
// Raised DELIBERATELY, by 451 chars, to spend part of that headroom on
// d365fo_file's operations[] (4,781 -> 5,232): several edits to one object in a
// single call. This is the trade the trim was for — the description costs ~450
// chars once per session, and it removes six or more round trips from every
// ordinary table change, each of which re-bills the entire cached context.
//
// Raised again by ~200 chars for prepare's `operation`, which makes prepare
// return the write contract itself. Deferring those contracts out of the schema
// (#825) had traded bytes for a discovery hop — get_knowledge(kind="op-spec")
// on nearly every write flow — and this buys the hop back for a fraction of
// what inlining them cost.
//
// Headroom is small on purpose so creep is caught early: both ceilings are the
// next round hundred above the measured payload.
//
// Phase 1.7 (reader payloads) added ~50 chars to get_object_info's `options`
// description to name the new pagination knobs — table fieldsOffset/fieldFilter
// and form maxControls. That is not optional text: a knob the model cannot see
// does not shrink anything, so those chars buy back thousands per call. Against
// main alone it needed the ceiling at 53_700; combined with the Phase 1.5 trim
// it fits far below, so the ceiling is set from the real measured payload.
//
// Raised by ~1,000 chars for get_knowledge's new kind="bp-moniker": validate an
// exact BP-check moniker, search by scenario when there is no moniker yet, or
// render a _BPSuppressions.xml <Diagnostic> block — all backed by names/text
// extracted from a real D365FO install (src/knowledge/bpMonikers/), not typed
// from memory. A moniker guessed wrong and only caught by reading the xppc log
// by hand is the failure this buys back. Only the four fields a caller cannot
// work without are published (action, moniker, path, justification); the rest —
// limit, message, severity, itemSpecific, and the elementType/elementName
// fallback for deriving a path — stay in the zod handler schema, the same trade
// already made for `labels`.
//
// Raised DELIBERATELY by ~350 chars for the three removal capabilities d365fo_file
// was missing: the `delete` action (an object's XML plus its .rnrproj entry) and
// the remove-control / remove-entry-point operations. All three are enum values
// plus one line of prose for the action — the parameters stay behind
// get_knowledge(kind="op-spec"), as #825 requires. An operation the model cannot
// see is an operation it works around by rewriting the whole object with
// action="create", overwrite=true, which costs orders of magnitude more than the
// enum value does and loses metadata as well.
//
// Raised by ~50 chars for add-query-range / remove-query-range — two XML-only
// operations for inserting/removing ViewMetadata filter ranges on data entities.
// Lowered to bank the removal of build_d365fo_project.buildReferencedModels, a
// parameter whose handler hard-codes `false` and ignores it (buildProject.ts).
// The ratchet only works in this direction: fit the change to the budget, never
// the budget to the change.
// Lowered again after unpublishing parameters no caller passed in 273 sampled
// tool calls (search: workspacePath/includeWorkspace/globalTypeFilter/deduplicate/
// crossReference; labels: the list/list-files and limit aliases; trigger_db_sync:
// tableName) and de-duplicating prose the tool description already carried. Every
// one of those keys is still accepted by its handler — only the advertisement is
// gone. Measured payload after the trim: 49_210.
// Lowered again after de-duplicating prose that two schemas stated twice:
// undo_last_modification carried the story of how it got its name, and
// find_references spelled the "Owner.method or it over-reports" rule out in full
// both in its description and in the parameter that rule applies to. Measured
// payload after: 48_904.
// Lowered again by the 2026-08-25 round-trip audit. prepare's `operation` now
// takes SEVERAL operations comma-separated, so ONE prepare returns every write
// contract an ordinary table change needs (add-field + add-index +
// add-field-to-field-group) instead of one — measured over 1,400 real MCP calls,
// get_knowledge was called 186 times against only 81 prepares, nearly all of them
// op-spec lookups a prepare could have answered. That clause was paid for inside
// the two schemas it belongs to, and then some: `prepare.mode` and
// `get_knowledge.kind` restated the enum bullet lists their own tool descriptions
// already carry, and `get_knowledge.topic` listed twelve example topics the
// description had already named. Measured payload after: 48_436.
// Lowered again by the same audit's post-build tools. verify_d365fo_project and
// run_bp_check now say WHEN they are worth calling — after a BUILD, not after a
// write, because d365fo_file already verifies its own write inline and
// build_d365fo_project(bpCheck:true) already folds the BP check into the build.
// That is what the 1,400-call sample shows being got wrong: 39 run_bp_check and
// 35 verify_d365fo_project calls, largely right after writes. Paid for inside
// those three schemas and then some, by unpublishing parameters that were never
// worth their bytes: run_bp_check's targetFilter/targetElementType (the
// single-object spelling of the objects[] the schema itself calls "preferred",
// passed 0 times in 273 sampled calls), verify's auto-resolved packageName/
// packagePath, and build's self-described "(Legacy)" projectPath. All five are
// still accepted by their handlers — only the advertisement is gone. Net across
// the three schemas, measured in isolation against HEAD: 48,904 -> 48,502.
// Measured payload for the whole tree after: 48_034.
// Lowered again by the same audit's Phase C, which folded three tools into the
// tools that already owned their subject and paid for the folds with trims —
// 23 published tools -> 20:
//   • undo_last_modification -> d365fo_file(action="undo"). `filePath` was
//     already on d365fo_file, the tool is already annotated destructive, and the
//     "discards ALL uncommitted changes to the file, not just the last edit"
//     warning moved with it.
//   • review_workspace_changes -> get_workspace_info(changes=true). Both LOCAL,
//     both read-only, both about one workspace. Its published description also
//     promised "BP violations, missing labels, CoC patterns" while the handler
//     ran `git diff HEAD --unified=3`; the folded knob says what it returns.
//   • trigger_db_sync -> build_d365fo_project(dbSync), on the `bpCheck`
//     precedent: a sync always follows a successful build.
// Paid for inside the schemas that grew, and then some: d365fo_file bought its
// `undo` enum value back out of its own prose (5,676 -> 5,649, still the largest
// tool), get_object_info stopped inlining the object-type enum a second time in
// objects[] (`search` already solved this the same way), four discriminator
// parameters stopped restating the bullet list their own tool description
// carries (generate_object.mode, security_info.mode, object_patterns.domain,
// validate_code.mode), and update_symbol_index dropped the half of its
// description that was an essay rather than the two facts the inventory test
// pins. All three retired names stay ROUTABLE, so an agent holding one still
// gets an answer. Measured payload after: 44_919.
// Then the three report-extension patterns (report-dataset-extension,
// report-custom-design, report-menu-redirect) were published, and paid for
// twice over inside generate_object's own schema, on the same principle: its
// `pattern` description opened with a roll-call of five values printed verbatim
// in the enum immediately above it, and its `params` description repeated the
// op-spec pointer that the tool description already carries. 73 chars of new
// enum, 138 chars of restatement removed. Measured payload after: 44_936 —
// below where it stood before the patterns were added.
