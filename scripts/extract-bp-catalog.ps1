.SYNOPSIS
    Regenerate the Best-Practice-rule moniker catalog from a local D365FO install.
.DESCRIPTION
    Ground truth for bp_moniker (src/knowledge/bpMonikers/) instead of a
    hand-typed list - every moniker has been guessed wrong at least once
    (issue: assistant proposed a moniker it could not verify, corrected only
    by reading the xppc log by hand).

    Two real sources on any D365FO dev box, both under PackagesLocalDirectory:

    1. Canonical names - every model ships
       <Model>/<Model>/AxRuleSet/BPRules.xml, a flat list of the monikers that
       model's BP rules can raise. The union across all models is the full
       canonical name set. This is what a *validate* lookup checks against.

    2. Real message/description text - the .NET-authored rule assemblies under
       bin/BPExtensions/*.dll (and a couple of core bin/*.dll) each carry a
       generated resx-backed `...Messages` (or `...DiagnosticItems` /
       `...Properties.Resources`) class: one string keyed by the moniker itself
       (the message template, with `{0}`-style placeholders) and, where the
       rule author wrote one, a second string keyed `<Moniker>Description`.
       This is what a *search* lookup matches against - real rule text, not a
       guess from the PascalCase name.

    Coverage of source 2 is high but not total. On the 10.0 install this was
    last measured against, 545 of 577 entries carried a real message and 221
    also carried a description, leaving 32 name-only - but those counts belong
    to one D365FO version, not to the catalog format, and every instance now
    extracts its own (see -OutFile), so do not quote them as current. The run
    prints its own figures at the end. What holds across versions is that the
    catalog marks a gap explicitly (`message` and `description` are null)
    rather than leaving it ambiguous, and a consumer must not treat
    "no description" as "not a real moniker".

    The reverse matters more: source 2 is a resource dump, so it also yields
    strings that are NOT BP rules - messages belonging to the upgrade and
    form-conversion tooling (DEC*, ActionPane*, ...). Those come out with
    `canonical: false` because no AxRuleSet lists them. `canonical` is the only
    field that answers "is this a BP rule"; presence in the catalog is not
    enough on its own.

    Two output modes. By default the script writes a generated TypeScript
    module rather than JSON: this project embeds knowledge data directly (see
    src/tools/knowledge/xppKnowledge.ts) so the committed snapshot ships in
    dist/ via the normal tsc build with no separate copy step. Given -OutFile
    it writes JSON instead, which is how one instance gets a catalog matching
    its own D365FO version rather than the shipped snapshot's - that file is
    read at runtime through BP_CATALOG_PATH, so it is data, not something to
    compile in.
.PARAMETER PackagesPath
    Root PackagesLocalDirectory to scan. Defaults to the newest
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Dynamics365\<version>\PackagesLocalDirectory found.
.PARAMETER OutFile
    When given, write a JSON file at this path instead of the default
    src\knowledge\bpMonikers\catalog.generated.ts TypeScript module. Used by
    the instance CLI (`d365fo-mcp instance rebuild/upgrade`) to give each
    instance its own catalog, matching that instance's actual D365FO version,
    instead of everyone sharing the one committed snapshot.

    The JSON carries a `sources` block (how many BPRules.xml files and rule
    DLLs were seen, and how many of each had to be skipped) next to `entries`.
    Both scans are best-effort, so a run that could read only part of the
    install still exits 0 - `sources` is what lets the caller notice that
    before it treats the result as this instance's current catalog.
.PARAMETER Version
    Stamped into the JSON output's `version` field alongside PackagesPath, so
    the caller's staleness check has something to compare against on the next
    run. Only meaningful with -OutFile; ignored otherwise. Purely a passthrough
    - this script does not attempt to discover the version itself, since a UDE
    config filename and a traditional-environment mtime hash are discovered
    differently and that logic belongs with the caller.
